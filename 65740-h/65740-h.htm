scholarly canonization and his unromantic owners. How he longs for the
irresponsible days when he was loved or ignored for his own sake! Now he is
forever imprisoned in marble busts and tortured in Histories of English Literature.

Therefore, a genius who has not been tagged unduly by the pundits
inspires me with a profound delicacy, in a sense akin to the reverence for a
beautiful child. Here is a virtue which the world needs. One would like to
proclaim it from the housetops. Yet there are the rabble, ready with their
election-night enthusiasm, and the scholars, with their pompous niches. If
one could only find all those whom the man himself would have selected as
friends and whisper the right word in their ears! But, after all, we must
speak in public, remembering that even misunderstanding is the birthright of
the genius. It is better that power should be expressed in devious and unforeseen
channels than not at all.

A flippant friend once told me that he had never had the courage to
read William Vaughn Moody because the poet had such a dark brown name.
That is important because of its triviality. I have no doubt that if the gospel
hymns had never been written, and if we had never on gloomy Sunday evenings
seen those pale books with the scroll-work Moody-and-Sankey covers,
bringing all their dismal train of musical and religious doggerel, we should
have been spared many misgivings about the evangelist’s vicarious name-sake.
Let it be firmly understood, therefore, that there is nothing dark
brown, or evangelistic, or stupidly sober-serious about the new poet of the
Fire-Bringer. May he never go into a household-classics edition!
</p>

<p>
But there is a tinge of New England about him, just the same. Only one
who has in his blood the solemn possibilities of religious emotion can react
against orthodox narrowness without becoming trivial. It is the fashion to
blame all modern ills on puritan traditions. We should be wise if in order
to fight our evils we should invoke a little of the Pilgrim Fathers’ heroism.
Too many of us take up the patter of radicalism with as little genuine sincerity
as a spearmint ribbon-clerk repeats the latest Sunday-comic slang.
If you have ever walked over a New England countryside the endless miles
of stone walls may have set you thinking. Every one of those millions of
stones has been laboriously picked out of the fields—and there are still many
there. Before that the trees had to be cleared away, and the Indians fought,
and the ocean crossed without chart or government buoy. For over two
centuries our ancestors grimly created our country for us, with an incessant
summer- and winter-courage that seems the attribute of giants. What
wonder if they were hard and narrow? We scoff at their terminal morraine;
but we should be more deserving of their gift if we should emulate
their stout hearts in clearing away the remaining debris from the economical
and spiritual fields. In spite of injurious puritan traditions there is something
inalienably American and truly great about old New England. It is
the same unafraid stoutness of heart that is at the bottom of Moody’s personality.
It gives him power; it gives him unconscious dignity.
</p>

<p>
Yet Moody was indeed a rebel against the religious and social muddle
in which he found himself. Something red and pagan poured into his veins
the instinct of defiance to a jealous god and to pale customs. The best
of the Greek was his; instinctively he turned at last to Greek drama for
his form and to Greek mythology for his figures. There was in him
that σπονδη which Aristotle believed essential for the poet—a quality
so rare among us that the literal translation, “high seriousness,” conveys
little hint of its warmth, its nobility and splendor. He believed in
the body as in the soul; and his conception of the godly was rounded
and not inhuman. Dionysus was every bit as real to him as the man
of sorrows. Is not this the new spirit of America which we wish to
nourish? And is there not a peculiar virtue in the poet who with the
<a id="page-4" class="pagenum" title="4"></a>
strong arm of the pilgrim and the consecration of the puritan fought
for the kingdom of joy among us? In <em>The Masque of Judgment</em> he pictures
a group of heroic unrepentant rebels against divine grace who
have not yet fallen under the sword of the destroying angel. Of them
one, a youth, sings:

But quotations crowd upon me. Most of Moody’s best work bears
witness to his glorification of man’s possible personality in rebellion
against man’s restrictive conception of society and god. We have had
many such rebels; the peculiar significance of Moody lies in the fact
that he lacks utterly the triviality of the little radical, and that his is
a power which springs from the most heroic in American quality.
</p>

<p>
Of course all this would be worth nothing unless Moody had the
authentic utterance of the poet. His fulness of inspiration, combined
with his sensitive editing, has left us scarcely a line which should have
gone to oblivion. As an example of his magic take three lines from <em>I Am
the Woman</em>, in which the woman is walking with her lover:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">But I was mute with passionate prophecies;</p>
      <p class="verse">My heart went veiled and faint in the golden weather,</p>
      <p class="verse">While universe drifted by after still universe.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
Or the woman’s response to Pandora’s singing in <em>The Fire-Bringer</em>:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Hark, hark, the pouring music! Never yet</p>
      <p class="verse">The pools below the waterfalls, thy pools,</p>
      <p class="verse">Thy dark pools, O my heart—!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
Fragmentary, mystic, unrelated with the context; yet who that has
heard perfect music can fail to understand that cry? It is indeed this
mystic richness, these depths below depths, that make a large part of
Moody’s individual fascination. He rarely has the limpid clarity or the
soaring simplicity which make the popular lyricist such as Shelley. There
is too much grasp of the mind in his work for the large public; only
those who have in some degree discovered the beauty of the wide ranges
can feel at home in him. One breathes with the strength of great virility,—an
able and demanding body, a mind which conquers the heights,
and those infinitely subtle and vibrating reaches of spirit which belong
especially to the poet.
</p>

<p>
To me the thought of Moody is satisfying not only because he typifies
those qualities which I like to think we ought to find in American
literature, but because he exemplifies my ideal of a poet. There have
been many insane geniuses; men whose glory has shone sometimes
fitfully through bodily or mental infirmity. Some of us are accustomed
to the idea that genius is in fact insanity or is akin to it. Certainly
the words “wholesome” and “healthy” have been applied so many
times to mediocre productions that we are wary of them. But is not
the insanity of genius after all merely the abnormal greatness and preponderance
of a single quality in a man? If by some miracle his other
qualities could have been equally great, would he not have been a
still nobler artist? To me the Greek impulse of proportionate development
has an irresistible appeal. To be sane, not by the denial of a
disproportionate inspiration, but by the lifting of all the faculties to its
<a id="page-6" class="pagenum" title="6"></a>
level: that is a dream worthy of the god in man. To be an artist not
by the denial of competing faculties, but by the fullest development
of all faculties under an inexorable will which unites them in a common
purpose: that is a rich conception of personality. The perfect
poet should be the perfect man. He should be not insane, but saner
than the rest of us. Moody not only expressed this ideal in his life,
but in his work. He was strong and sound, physically, mentally, spiritually.
No one who has read his letters can miss the golden roundness
of his humor, his humanity, his manliness. Yet never for a moment
did he make a comfortable denial of the will to soar. In his poem <em>The
Death of Eve</em> he has burningly expressed the development of personality.
Eve, an aged woman, has not succumbed to the view that she committed
an unforgivable sin in disobeying God to taste the apple. Taking old
Cain with her, she fearlessly enters the garden again to show herself to God
before she dies. In her mystic song she sings:

      <p class="verse">A pitcher filled, she comes back from the brook,</p>
      <p class="verse">A wain she comes, laden with mellow ears;</p>
      <p class="verse">She is a roll inscribed, a prophet’s book</p>
      <p class="verse">Writ strong with characters.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
And after singing of her life and of how she had been sensitive to the
love of her husband and children, she goes on:

      <p class="verse">But still along the yonder edge of prayer</p>
      <p class="verse">A spirit in a fiery whirlwind came—</p>
      <p class="verse">Eve’s spirit, wild and fair—</p>
      <p class="verse">Crying with Eve’s own voice the number of her name.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Yea, turning in the whirlwind and the fire,</p>
      <p class="verse">Eve saw her own proud being all entire</p>
      <p class="verse">Made perfect by desire;</p>
      <p class="verse">And from the rounded gladness of that sphere</p>
      <p class="verse">Came bridal songs and harpings and fresh laughter;</p>

<p class="noindent">
This is not the balance of a personality that denies itself! Like Nietzsche,
Moody is shaken with the conviction that the most deadly sin is not disobedience,
but smallness.
</p>

<p>
There is a striking similarity between the religious attitude of Moody
and that of Nietzsche. Moody mentions Zarathustra only once in his
published letters. Certainly he was not obsessed by the German, or a confessed
follower. Nor did Moody elaborate any social philosophy, beyond a
general radicalism quite different from Nietzsche’s condemnation of socialism.
But, like Nietzsche, Moody was in reaction against a false and narrow
culture. And like him, Moody found in Hellenic ideals a blood-stirring
inspiration. He found not the external grace of the Greek which Keats
celebrated, not the static classical perfection which has furnished an anodyne
for scholars. It was the deeper, cloudy spirit of Aeschylus, the heaven-scaling
challenge of Euripides, the Dionysiac worship of joy and passion.
Take, for instance, the chorus of young men in <em>The Fire-Bringer</em>
which Professor Manly has called “insolent”—though it seems to me of a
divine insolence:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Eros, how sweet</p>
      <p class="verse">Is the cup of thy drunkenness!</p>

      <p class="verse">Hasten to the burning cup</p>
      <p class="verse">Thou liftest up!</p>
      <p class="verse">But O how sweet and how most burning it is</p>
      <p class="verse">To drink the wine of thy lightsome chalices,</p>
      <p class="verse">Apollo! Apollo! To-day</p>
      <p class="verse">We say we will follow thee and put all others away</p>
      <p class="verse">For thou alone, O thou alone art he</p>

      <p class="verse">And sometimes leadest the rapt soul on</p>

      <p class="verse">Of vision and of dream</p>
      <p class="verse">She stands</p>
      <p class="verse">With startled eyes and outstretched hands,</p>
      <p class="verse">Looking where other suns rise over other lands,</p>
      <p class="verse">And rends the lonely skies with her prophetic scream.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
Moody, too, transvaluates values everywhere. <em>The Death of Eve</em> is an example
of it. It is to “The Brute” that he looks for the regeneration of
society. Prometheus is a heroic saviour of mankind; rebellion is his virtue,
<a id="page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>
not his sin. Pandora is not a mischievous person who through her curiosity
lets out all the troubles on the world, but a divine, wind-like inquirer,
the inspiration of Prometheus. The God of judgment-day is himself swept
away by the destruction of mankind for the sins of commission. And the
insignificance of man compared with what he might be is satirically shown
in <em>The Menagerie</em>.

Here, surely, is an American poet who speaks in eternal terms of the
new inspiration; one who was sane and blazing at the same time; one who
in order to be modern did not need to use a poor imitation of Whitman,
screech of boiler factories and exalt a somewhat doubtful brand of democracy;
one who was uncompromisingly radical without being feverish; above
all, one who succeeded in writing the most beautiful verse without going to
London to do it. When one is oppressed with the doubt of American possibilities
it is a renewal of faith to turn to him. If Whitman is of our
soil, Moody is no less so; through these two the best in us has thus far
found its individual expression.

<span class="firstchar">Ἑ</span><span class="postfirstchar">υρηκα!—shouted</span> the Incurable, when I came on my monthly call. I
have solved the mystery that has baffled your idealists since the outbreak
of the War. The puerile effusions of Hardy, Galsworthy, and other
Olympians who in the mist of international hostilities confused Nietzsche
with Bernhardi, are quite explainable. It is well known that our successful
writers have no time or inclination to read other fellows’ books: they
leave this task to journalists and book-reviewers. Hence their splendid
ignorance of Nietzsche. The advent of great events showered upon the
innocent laymen problems, names, and terms that have been a <em>terra incognita</em>
to most of them, and justly so: for what has the artist to do with
facts and theories,—what is Hecuba to him? But of late it has become
“stylish” for men of letters to declare their opinions on all sorts of questions,
regardless of the fact that they have as much right to judge those
problems as the cobbler has the right to judge pastry. To the aid of the
English novelists who wanted to say “something about the war,” but whose
information on the subject was zero, came the dear professor Cramb. A
quick perusal of his short work<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-1" id="fnote-1">[1]</a> supplied the students with an outlook
and a view-point, and out came the patriotic cookies to the astonishment
of the world. Such, at least, is my interpretation of the mystery.

New York.]
</p>

<p>
Professor Cramb’s lectures are not an answer to Bernhardi, as the
publisher wants us to believe, but rather a supplement to the work of the
barrack-philosopher whose theory of the biological necessity of war is beautifully
corroborated with numerous quotations from the most ancient to
the most modern philosophers, historians, statesmen, and poets. The
general splendidly demonstrates the efficiency of German mind, the ability
to utilize the world culture for the Fatherland, to make all thinkers serve
the holy idea of war, from Heraclitus’s πὸλεμος πατήρ πάντων to Schiller’s Bride
from Messina. Yet I, in my great love for Germany, should advise the
Kaiser’s government to appropriate a generous sum for the purpose of
spreading far and wide Cramb’s “Answer,” as the highest glorification of
Teutonia. No German has expressed more humble respect and admiration
<a id="page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
for Treitschke, Bernhardi, and other eulogists of the Prussian mailed
fist than this English dreamer of a professor. For what but a fantastic
dream is his picture of modern Germany as that of a land permeated with
heroic aspirations, a mélange of Napoleonism and Nietzscheanism? Nay!
it is the burgher, the “culture-philistine” that dominates the land of Wilhelm
and Eucken, the petty Prussian, the parvenu who since 1870 has been
cherishing the idea of <em>Weltmacht</em> and of the Germanization of the universe.

<p>
Pardon me, friend, I cannot speak <em>sina ira</em> on this question; out of
respect for Mr. Wilson’s request, let us “change the subject.” Come out
where we can observe in silence the symphony of autumnal sunset. The
Slavs call this month “Listopad,” the fall of leaves; do you recall
Tschaikovsky’s <em>Farewell Ye Forests</em>? Sing it in silence, in that eloquent
silence of which Maeterlinck had so beautifully spoken. I say <em>had</em>, for my
heart is full of anxiety for that Belgian with the face of an obstinate
coachman. His last works reveal symptoms of Monomania, that sword
of Damocles that hangs over many a profound thinker, particularly so if
the thinker is inclined towards mysticism. Maeterlinck, as no one else,
has felt the mystery of our world; his works echoed his awe before the unknown,
the impenetrable, but also his love for the mysterious, his rejoicing
at the fact that there are in our life things unexplainable and incomprehensible.
His latest essays<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-2" id="fnote-2">[2]</a> show signs of dizziness, as of a man who
stands on the brink of an abyss. I fear for him; I fear that the artist has
lost his equilibrium and is obsessed with phantasms, psychometry, and other
nonsense. The veil of mystery irritates him, he craves to rend it asunder,
to answer all riddles, to clarify all obscurities, to interpret the unknowable;
as a result he falls into the pit of charlatanism and credulity.

If there were no more insoluble questions nor impenetrable riddles, infinity would
not be infinite; and we should have forever to curse the fate that placed us in a universe

an irreparable evil and mistake. The unknown and unknowable are necessary to our
happiness. In any case I would not wish my worst enemy, were his understanding a

as a man, he had begun to grasp the least atom.

These words were written by Maeterlinck a few years ago in his essay,
<em>Our Eternity</em>. He has surely gone astray since. The last book is written
in a dull pale style, in a tone of a professional table-rapper, enumerating
legions of “facts” to prove the theory of psychometry or whatever it may
be, forgetting his own words of some time ago: “Facts are nothing but
the laggards, the spies, and camp followers of the great forces we cannot
see.” What a tragedy!

<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
Was Dostoevsky a mystic? Undoubtedly so, but not exclusively so.
Far from being a monomaniac, he applied his genius to various aspects
of life and wistfully absorbed the realistic manifestations of his fellow-beings
as well as the inner struggles of their souls. Dostoevsky is the
Cézanne of the novel. With the same eagerness that Cézanne puts into
his endeavor to produce the “treeness” of a tree, brushing aside irrelevant
details, does Dostoevsky strive to present the “soulness” of a soul, stripping
it of its veils and demonstrating its throbbing nudeness before our
terrified eyes. We fear him, for he is cruel and takes great pleasure in
torturing us, in bringing us to the verge of hysteria; we fear him, for we
feel uneasy when we are shown a nude soul. Perhaps he owed his wonderful
clairvoyancy to his ill health, a feature that reminds us of his great
disciple, Nietzsche. I do not know which is more awesome in Raskolnikov<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-3" id="fnote-3">[3]</a>:
his physical, realistic tortures, or his mysterious dreams and hallucinations.
In all his heroes: the winged murderer who wished to kill a
principle; the harlot, Sonya, who sells her body for the sake of her drunkard
father and her stepmother; the father, Marmeladov, whose monologues
in the tavern present the most heart-gripping rhapsody of sorrow and despair;
the perversed nobleman, Svidrigailov, broad-hearted and cynical, who
jokingly blows out his brains—in the whole gallery of his morbid types
Dostoevsky mingles the real with the fantastic, makes us wander in the
labyrinth of illusionary facts and preternatural dreams, brings us in dizzily-close
touch with the nuances of palpitating souls, and leaves us mentally
maimed and stupefied. I think of Dostoevsky as of a Demon, a Russian
Demon, the sorrowful Demon of the poet Lermontov, the graceful humane
Mephistopheles of the sculptor Antokolsky.

</p>

<p>
The tragedy of Raskolnikov is twofold: he is a Russian and an intellectual.
The craving, religious soul of the child of the endless melancholy
plains, keened by a profound, analytic intellect seeks in vain an outlet
for its strivings and doubtings in the land where interrogation marks
are officially forbidden. The young man should have plunged into the
Revolution, the broad-breasted river that has welcomed thousands of Russian
youth; but Dostoevsky willed not his hero to take the logical road.
The epileptic Demon hated the “Possessed” revolutionists; he saw the
Russian ideal in Christian suffering. “He is a great poet, but an abominable
creature, quite Christian in his emotions and at the same time quite
<em>sadique</em>. His whole morality is what you have baptised slave-morality”—this
from Dr. Brandes’s letter to Nietzsche,—a specimen of professorial
nomenclature.
</p>

<p>
I am thinking of a threefold—nay, of a manifold—tragedy of a young
<a id="page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
man, who, besides being a Russian and an intellectual, is a revolutionist
and is a son of the eternal Ahasver, the people that have borne for centuries
the double cross of being persecuted and of teaching their persecutors.
What makes this tragedy still more tragic is the element of grim
irony that enters it as in those of Attic Greece: the Russian-Jewish-Anarchist
is hurled by Fate into the country of Matter-of-Fact, your United
States. The boy is poetic, sentimental, idealistic; imbued with the lofty
traditions of the Narodovoltzy, the Russian saints-revolutionists, he craves
for a heroic deed, for an act of self-sacrifice for the “people.” “Ah, the
People! The grand, mysterious, yet so near and real, People....”<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-4" id="fnote-4">[4]</a> He
attempts to shoot an oppressor of the people, is delivered to the Justice,
and is sentenced to twenty-two years of prison confinement. The curtain
falls, but does the tragedy end here? No, it only begins.

Raskolnikov wanted to kill a principle; he wanted to rid the world of
a useless old pawnbroker, in order to enable himself to <em>live</em> a useful life.
He failed; the principle remained deadly alive in the form of a gnawing
conscience. “I am an aesthetic louse,” he bitterly denounces himself.
Alexander Berkman wanted to <em>die</em> for a principle, to render the people a
service through his death. He has failed. At least he has thought so. The
Attentat produced neither the material nor the moral effect that the idealist
had expected. Society condemned him, of course; the strikers, for whose
benefit he eagerly gave his life, looked upon his act as on a grave misfortune
that would augment their misery; even his comrades, except a very few,
disapproved of his heroic deed. The icy reality sobered the naïve Russian.
Was it worth while? For the “people?”
</p>

<p>
The <em>Memoirs</em> have stirred me more profoundly than Dostoevsky’s
<em>Memoirs from a House of the Dead</em>, far more than Wilde’s <em>De Profundis</em>:
the tragedy here is so much more complex, more appalling in its utter illogicality.
On the other hand the book is written so sincerely, so heartedly,
so ingenuously, that you feel the wings of the martyr’s soul flapping
upon yours. Berkman becomes so near, so dear, that it pains to think of
him. You are with him throughout his vicissitudes; you share his anguish,
loneliness, suicidal moods; your spirit and your body undergo the same
inhuman tortures, the same unnecessary cruelties, that he describes so
simply, so modestly; you rejoice in his pale prison joys, your heart goes
out to the gentle boy, Johnny, who whispers through the dungeon wall his
love for Sashenka; you weep over the death of Dick, the friendly sparrow
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
whose chirping sounded like heavenly music to the prisoner; you are filled
with admiration and love for the Girl who hovers somewhere outside like
a goddess, “immutable,” devoted, noble, reserved; you are, lastly, out in
the free, and how deeply you sympathize with the sufferer when he flees
human beings and solicitous friends.... When I read through the bleeding
pages, I felt like falling on my knees and kissing the feet of the unknown,
yet so dear, martyr. Surely, thou hast known suffering....
</p>

<p>
Don’t sneer at my incurable sentimentality, you happy normal. The
tragedy of Alexander Berkman is common to all of us, transplanted wild
flowers. It is the tragedy of getting the surrogate for the real thing.
Berkman and the Girl passionately kissing the allegorical figure of the Social
Revolution—isn’t this the symbol of the empty grey life in this normal
land? What do you offer the seeking, striving, courageous souls but
surrogates, substitutes? Your radicals—they are nauseating! They chatter
about Nietzsche and Stirner and Whitman, wave the red flag and scream
about individual freedom; but let one of them transgress the seventh commandment
or commit any thing that is not <em>comme il faut</em> according to their
code, and lo, the radicalism has evaporated, and the atavistic mouldy morality
has come to demonstrate its wrinkled face. Has not John Most repudiated
the act of his disciple, Berkman, because it was a <em>real</em> act and not
a paper allegory? Of course, Most was German....

always be recognized. Unfortunately the latter half of that
statement seems no longer true, especially of latter-day poetry. Fratricidal

the people whose contribution to poetry is their appreciation of it—and

I always thought I could recognize authentic poetry on most themes
and even flattered myself that I had some little understanding of the psychology
of its production. Latterly two voices have come to me, one affirming
that I was right in my prejudice that all durable verse should have content
as well as form, should have meaning as well as sound—though in closest
union with the sound,—that, in short, the poet should be a thinker as well
as a craftsman; an emotional thinker, of course, if that term be permitted,
but not a mere clairaudient wielder of words. And then I heard a voice
which bid me forget all that and list to

Hastening to give credit where it is due, let me remind the readers of
<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> that this is the last line of a poem by Maxwell Bodenheim
in the last number of that periodical. I trust that Mr. Bodenheim
will forgive me for using him to point a moral and adorn a critical article,
especially as I shall have to compare him with Wordsworth before I get
through, and shall have to ask him whether he is not carrying the Wordsworthian
tradition just a little too far into the region of the individual and
subjective, into the unknown territory of the most isolated thing in the
world: the human mind in those regions of it which have not been socially
disciplined into the categories which make communication possible between
mind and mind.
</p>

<p>
The other voice which I have mentioned is that of Professor S. B.
Gass, of the University of Nebraska, who writes on Literature as a Fine
Art in <em>The Mid-West Quarterly</em> for July.
</p>

<p>
Professor Gass takes the very sane position that words are the socially-created
tools—arbitrary symbols, he calls them—to give us “not the thing
itself, but something about the thing—some relationship, some classification,
some generalization, some cause, some effect, some attribute, something
that goes on wholly in the mind and is not sensuously present in the thing
<a id="page-16" class="pagenum" title="16"></a>
itself.” And that work, he continues, is thought, and it proceeds by statement.
But undoubtedly words have sensuous sounds and sensuous denotations and
connotations. Professor Gass admits this, but regards their sensuous properties—and
especially, I imagine he would insist, their sensuous sounds based
on physiological accident—as secondary. Hence, to him, Imagism would be a
use of words for purely secondary results. And that is decadence: “Decadence
arises out of the primary pursuit of secondary functions.” Now
Wordsworth and the romantic school generally used words in this way, and
so, logically enough, Professor Gass classifies Wordsworth as a decadent.
In doing so we fear he exhibits an intellect too prone to <a id="corr-5"></a>dichotomize. He
cuts human psychology up into too many and too water-tight compartments.
When he quotes Wordsworth’s
</p>

<div class="excerpt">

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="noindent">
he seems to forget that there is more in that poem than its imagism—as
we would call it now; that it is record of a personal experience, that is not
only a trespass on the domain of the painter (to speak as if we agreed with
our critic) but that it is a personal reaction to the picture painted in those
words, that it tells us something that no mere picture could do. The poem,
in fact, is a picture plus a story of the effect of the picture upon a human
soul.
</p>

<p>
But the point in which I agree with Professor Gass is that—whatever
the ultimate purpose of literature, including the lyric; whether, as he says,
it is “a reflection of human nature, intellectual in its mode, critical in its
spirit, and moral in its function”; or whether it is legitimate to regard its
rhythms in words and “secondary” connotations and associations of words
as materials for an art rather than for a criticism of life—the point beyond
all this that I think fundamental is that literature does what it does—inform,
enlighten, or transport—by understandable statement.
</p>

<p>
Certainly all appreciation of literature that dares to voice itself—that
is all criticism—must proceed on this supposition, and it is just this supposition
that is flouted by some of Mr. Bodenheim’s poems.
</p>

<p>
Take the following, for instance:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">

  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">

      <p class="verse">Men and women come to you to loosen your supple frame,</p>
      <p class="verse">And weave another slim square into you—</p>
      <p class="verse">Or perhaps a blue oblong, a saffron circle.</p>
      <p class="verse">People fling their powdered souls at you:</p>
      <p class="verse">You seem to lose them, but retain</p>
      <p class="verse">The shifting shadow of a stain on your rigid lines.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
<a id="page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
Now obviously there is no sense in this in the ordinary intellectualistic
meaning of the word sense. Unlike most poetry, it cannot be analyzed into
a content which we might say was expressed suitably or unsuitably in a
form. If, then, it be a good poem, we must look elsewhere for its excellence.
I would hesitate to find that excellence in the mere sound of the
words. Is it then in their associations? Arthur Ransome, the English critic,
accounts for the peculiar effect of poetry by its use of what he calls potential
language—of words which by long association have come to mean more
than they say, that have not only a denotation like scientific words, but a
sometimes definite, sometimes hazy, connotation, an emotional content over
and above what is intellectually given in their purely etymological content.
Does this help us here? I am afraid not. Personally I have always associated
sieves with ashes and garden-earth (there is also a little triangular
sieve that fits into kitchen sinks). Blue oblongs and saffron circles remind
me of advertising posters and futurist pictures; while—I admit a certain
poetic quality of a sort here—powdered souls remind me of Aubrey Beardsley.
</p>

<p>
But, perhaps, the ultimate objection to this poem as it stands is the fact
that I have an uneasy suspicion that some printer may have transposed some
of these expressions. For would it not really have made better sense if the
poem had spoken of a saffron oblong and a blue square? Certainly if I
choose to think that that is what it must have been originally no other reader,
on the face of the matter, could convince me otherwise. While, if another
reader told me that Mr. Bodenheim had once studied geometry and therefore
could not possibly have written about a “slim square”, I would be quite
unable to convince him otherwise.
</p>

<p>
But—it will be objected—it is quite unfair to any poem to analyze it
word by word. It spoils its beauty. I challenge the assertion, and even
assert the opposite. As a matter of fact, it is only by analysis that we can
tell good poetry from bad poetry. For instance:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Crown him with many crowns</p>
      <p class="verse">The lamb upon his throne.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
Analyze that and it straightway appears the nonsense that it really is. But,
on the other hand, take this poem of Francis Thompson’s (I quote only a
part):
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Does the fish soar to find the ocean,</p>
      <p class="verse">The eagle plunge to find the air—</p>
      <p class="verse">That we ask of the stars in motion</p>
      <p class="verse">If they have rumour of thee there?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Not where the wheeling systems darken,</p>
      <p class="verse">And our benumbed conceiving soars!—</p>
      <p class="verse">The drift of pinions, would we hearken,</p>
      <p class="verse">Beats at our own clay-shuttered doors.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
<a id="page-18" class="pagenum" title="18"></a>
      <p class="verse">The angels keep their ancient places;—</p>
      <p class="verse">Turn but a stone, and start a wing!</p>
      <p class="verse">’Tis ye, ’tis your estrangèd faces,</p>
      <p class="verse">That miss the many-splendored thing.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
Now that poem, it will be observed, is not unrelated in subject to
the two lines quoted just above it. And yet, how it defies any effort to
analyze it out into anything else than itself. Rhythm, cosmic picturings,
the homely metaphors of the dusty road, all combine to place us in an
attitude toward, to give us a feeling for, reality, which is different from,
and nobler than, those of the man who has either never read this poem,
never read the same message in other poetic language, or—what is more
to the point—never managed to get for himself the same experience which
dictated that poem.
</p>

<p>
For, after all, if I were to agree with Professor Gass that poetry (as
a part of literature) is not a fine art, it would be because I think it more
than a fine art. Because I think the function of poetry is not merely to be
a verbal picture art or a verbal music art, but to be an organon of reconciliation
between art and life. The best poems, I think, will be found to be those
which alter our consciousness in such a way that our inward, and even our
outward, lives are altered. The poet sees the world as we do not see it.
Consequently, he can put a new complexion on it for us. The world is
pluralistic, and so are we. Intellectually we may be of the twentieth century,
but emotionally we may be born out of our due season. Then let the
poet of that due season mediate to us the emotional life that we need.
Living in America, we may, through him, reach Greece or India. By his
aid we may conquer the real world; by his aid we may flee from it if it
threatens to conquer us. By his aid alone we may get outside of our own
skins and into the very heart of the world.
</p>

<p>
What, then, shall we say, when poetry offers to conduct us into a world
of growing sieves, slim squares, powdered souls, cool, colorless struggles,
the obstetrical adventures of white throats, and green and yellow dins?
</p>

<p>
I have heard of a book which explains the fourth dimension. If I ever
get a chance to read that book, and if I find that I can understand the fourth
dimension, I shall have another shot at the appreciation of this poetry. For
I have a slumbering shadow of a pale-gray idea (if I, too, may wax poetic)
that in the sphere of the fourth dimension a slim square would be a perfectly
possible conception.
</p>

<p>
I shall arise and go home now and read some poems by the late Mr.
Meredith who is popularly supposed to be obscure.

In Defense of Vers Libre
</h3>

<p class="note">
(<em>A reply to “Spiritual Dangers of Writing Vers Libre” by Eunice Tietjens
in the November issue of The Little Review</em>)
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The properly qualified judge of poetry can have no doubts about <em>vers
libre</em>; if he doubts it, he is no judge. He belongs to that class of
hide-bound conservatives who are unwilling to discard the old merely because
it is old. He does not yet understand that the newest is always the
best. Worst of all, he does not appreciate the value of Freedom.
</p>

<p>
Freedom is the greatest of boons to the artist. The soul of the artist
must not be hampered by unnecessary constraints. The old fixed verse-forms—such
as the sonnet, blank verse, and all the other familiar metres—were
exactly as cramping to the free creating spirit of the poet as the
peculiar spaces and arches of the Sistine Chapel were to the designing instinct
of Michael Angelo. Lamentable misfortune! that his Sibyls had to
occupy those awkward corners. How much would they not have gained in
grandeur could they have had all outdoors to expand in!
</p>

<p>
All outdoors is just what <em>vers libre</em> affords the poet of today. He is
no longer under the necessity of moulding his thought into an artificial pattern,
compressing it to a predetermined form; it can remain fluent, unsubjugated,
formless, like a spontaneous emotional cry. No longer need he
accept such fatal and stereotyped bondage as that under which Milton
labored when the iron mechanics of blank verse forced him to standardize,
to conventionalize, his emotion in such lines as—
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">O dark dark dark amid the blaze of noon,</p>
      <p class="verse">Irrecoverably dark, total eclipse</p>
      <p class="verse">Without all hope of day!...</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
To be honest, we must admit that there was something sickly and
soul-destroying about the earlier verse-forms. The too-honeyed sweetness
and metrical constraint of <em>Paradise Lost</em> has always secretly repelled the
true judge of poetry; and Shakespeare’s Sonnets have never been thoroughly
satisfactory just because of the fatal necessity under which the author
worked, of rhyming his lines in conformity with a fixed order. How could
spiritual originality survive such an ordeal?
</p>

<p>
It would be unwise, however, to condemn the whole body of past poets;
for certain of the earlier practitioners did, in their rudimentary way, see
the light. Milton in <em>Sampson Agonistes</em>, in the midst of passages of the
old-fashioned regular blank verse, introduced several choruses in <em>vers libre</em>;
and these could perhaps hardly be surpassed by any English or American
poet now living. As everyone knows, Walt Whitman (see <em>The Poets of
<a id="page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
Barbarism</em> by George Santayana) used <em>vers libre</em> profusely. In fact, there
extends backward from us an unbroken chain of distinguished <em>vers libre</em>
tradition, through Whitman, Matthew Arnold, Southey, Shelley, Milton, and
many others; the chain ends only with that first “probably arboreal” singer
just antedating the first discoverer of regular rhythm. <em>Vers libre</em> is as old
as the hills, and we shall always have it with us.
</p>

<p>
The one defect of the earlier practitioners of <em>vers libre</em> was that they
did not have the wit to erect it into a cult. They used the free form only
when it seemed to them essentially appropriate to the matter:—that is to say,
they used <a id="corr-6"></a>it sporadically, desultorily. Today we know better. Today we
know that the free form must be used ever and always. <em>In hoc signo vinces!</em>
</p>

<p>
As a modern poet admirably says—
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Those envious outworn souls</p>
      <p class="verse">Whose flaccid <a id="corr-7"></a>academic pulses</p>
      <p class="verse">Beat to no rythms of more Dionysiac scope</p>
      <p class="verse"><a id="corr-9"></a>Than metronomes,—</p>
      <p class="verse">Or dollar-twenty-five alarm-clocks,—</p>
      <p class="verse">They will forever</p>
      <p class="verse">Cavail at novelty, at beauty, at freshness;</p>
      <p class="verse">But, hell!—</p>
      <p class="verse">But, a thousand devils!—</p>
      <p class="verse">But, <em>Henri Quatre</em> and the <em>Pont Neuf</em>!—</p>
      <p class="verse">We of the new age, who leap upon the mountains like goats upon the heaps of tin cans in the vacant lots, and butt the stars,—</p>
      <p class="verse">We know they are liars,</p>
      <p class="verse">And that we are what we are.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
Could that be expressed in a sonnet? I think not. At least, it could
not be expressed so vigorously, so wisely, so well.
</p>

<p>
There is, however, one obvious peril against which the enthusiast must
guard himself. <em>Vers libre</em> is not of itself a complete warranty of success;
because a poem is in this form, it is not necessarily fine poetry. “Love is
enough,” says William Morris; he would not have said the same about
<em>vers libre</em>. A certain power of conception, beyond the brilliant and original
idea involved in the very employing of the free verse-form, is requisite for
real importance in the finished product.
</p>

<p>
Nor is the statement of the poet’s own unique and terrifying importance
a sufficient theme to constitute the burden of all his work. Several of our
most immortal living <em>vers librists</em> have fallen into such an error. This
“ego über alles” concept, though profound and of a startling originality,
lacks variety if it be indefinitely repeated. Should the poet, however, feel
deep in his soul that there is nothing else worth saying except this, let him
at least take care to beautify his idea by the use of every artifice. After
saying “I am I, and great,” let him not forget to add variety and contrast
to the picture by means of the complementary idea: “You, O world, are you,
<a id="page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>
and contemptible.” In such minglings of light and shade lies poetry’s special
and proper beauty.
</p>

<p>
<em>Vers libre</em> has one incontestable advantage over all those more artificial
vehicles in which the poets of the past have essayed to ride into immortality.
This newly popular verse-form can be used perfectly well when
the poet is drunk. Let no one of temperate habits underestimate this advantage;
let him think of others. Byron was drunk most of the time; had
he been able to employ a form like this, how many volumes could he perhaps
have added to the mere seventeen that now constitute his work! Shelley,—seldom
alcoholicly affected, I believe,—was always intoxicated with ideas;
he, equipped solely with the new instrument, could have written many more
epics like <em>Queen Mab</em>, and would probably have felt less need of concentrating
his work into the narrow limits of such formalistic poems as <em>The West
Wind</em>.
</p>

<p>
Let it be understood that all the principles suggested in this monograph
are intended only for the true devotee of <em>vers libre</em>. One can have nothing
but contempt for the poet who, using generally the old-fashioned metres,
turns sometimes to <em>vers libre</em> as a medium, and carries over into it all those
faults of restrained expression and patterned thought which were the curse
of the old forms. Such a writer is beyond hope, beyond counsel. We can
forgive Matthew Arnold, but not a contemporary.
</p>

<p>
Certain devoted American friends of poetry have been trying for some
time to encourage poetry in this country; and I think they are on the right
track when they go about it by way of encouraging <em>vers libre</em>. No other
method could so swiftly and surely multiply the number of our verse-writers.
For the new medium presents no difficulties to anyone; even the tired
business-man will find himself tempted to record his evening woes in singless
song. True, not everyone will be able at first trial to produce <em>vers libre</em>
of the quality that appears in the choruses of <em>Sampson Agonistes</em>:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
          <p class="verse2">This, this is he; softly a while;</p>
      <p class="verse">Let us not break in upon him.</p>
      <p class="verse">O change beyond report, thought, or belief!</p>
      <p class="verse">See how he lies at random, carelessly diffused,</p>
      <p class="verse">With languished head unpropt,</p>
      <p class="verse">As one past hope, abandoned,</p>

      <p class="verse">O’er-worn and soiled.</p>
      <p class="verse">Or do my eyes misrepresent? Can this be he,</p>

      <p class="verse">Irresistible Sampson? whom, unarmed,</p>
      <p class="verse">No strength of man, or fiercest wild beast, could withstand?...</p>

<p class="noindent">
<a id="page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
That is indeed admirable, and not so easy to write as it looks. But
some kind of <em>vers libre</em> can be turned out by anyone; and to encourage
the use of this medium will be to encourage and vastly increase that multitudinous
body of humble and industrious versifyers who are at present
the most conspicuous ornament of American literature.

<h3 class="section" id="THE_DECORATIVE_STRAIGHTJACKET">
The Decorative Straight-Jacket: Rhymed Verse
</h3>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Maxwell Bodenheim</span>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The clamping of the inevitable strait-jacket, rhymed verse, upon the
shrinking form of poetry has been the pastime of centuries. Those who
would free poetry from the outworn metal bands and let her stretch her
cramped limbs are labeled decadent, slothful, and futile. How easy it is to
paste disagreeable labels upon the things one happens to dislike.
</p>

<p>
I admit that poetry freed from the bonds she has so long worn may
become vulgar and over-demonstrative. A convict who has just been released
from a penitentiary is perhaps inclined to caper down the road, and
split the air with good red shouts. But after his first excesses he walks
slowly, thinking of the way before him. With some poets free verse is still
the boisterous convict; with others it is already the sober, determined individual.
But I rather like even the laughing convict, looking back and flinging
huge shouts at his imposing but petty prison.
</p>

<p>
Suppose I were a Bluebeard who had enticed a young girl into my dim
chamber of poetic-thought. Suppose I took the little knife of rhyme and
coolly sliced off one of her ears, two or three of her fingers, and finished by
clawing out a generous handful of her shimmering, myriad-tinted hair, with
the hands of meter. I might afterwards display her to the world, saying:
“Look! Is she not still beautiful, still almost perfect?” But would that excuse
my butchery? The lesson is perhaps fairly clear. Rhymed verse mutilates
and cramps poetry. It is impossible for even the greatest poet completely
to rise above its limitations. He may succeed in a measure, but that
is due to his strength and not to the useless fetters he wears. But, say the
defenders of the fetters, rhyme and meter are excellent disciplines. Does
Poetry or does the Poet need to be disciplined? Are they cringing slaves
who cannot be trusted to walk alone and unbound? These are obvious
things, but one must sometimes <a id="corr-11"></a>be obvious when speaking to those who still
possess a childish belief. Poetry is not determined by the monotonous form
in which it is usually clothed, but by the strength or weakness of its voice.
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
Because men have foolishly placed this voice in the mouth of a child, wearing
a dress with so many checks on it, and a hat the blackness of which matches
the ebony of its ugly shoes, it does not necessarily follow that the voice becomes
miraculously changed when placed in some other mouth, whose owner
wears a different garb. Then there is the rhythm difficulty. If the little
child, Rhyme and Meter, does not swing his foot in time to what he is saying,
adding rhythm, his words, according to some, change from poetry to
prose. What delightful superstitions!
</p>

<p>
Poets can undoubtedly rise to great heights, in spite of the fact that they
must replace stronger words with weaker ones, because “passion” does not
rhyme with “above,” but “love” does. But how much higher could they
rise if they were free? I do not say that to eliminate rhyme, meter, and
rhythm is to make the way absolutely clear. The Poet must still be a Poet
to climb. Nor do I say that if the Poet finds that rhyme, rhythm, and meter
happen almost to fit his poetic thoughts, he must not use them. I only say
that the poet who finds that the usual forms of poetry confine and mar his
poetic thoughts should be able to discard them without receiving the usual
chorus of sneers, and that if he does he is not miraculously changed from a
poet to a writer of prose.

Harriet Monroe’s Poetry
</h3>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Eunice Tietjens</span>
</p>

<p class="book">
<em>You and I</em>, by Harriet Monroe. [The Macmillan Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Right here in Chicago, under our very noses, there is dwelling personified
a Real Force. It is done up in a neat and compact little package, as
most real forces are that are not of the Krupp variety, and it works with
so little fuss and fury that it takes some discernment to recognize it for a
force at all. Nevertheless it is a power which is felt throughout the length
and breadth of the country, in California, in Florida, in Canada, and in
England. And wherever it is felt it is a liberating force, a force that
ruthlessly shatters the outworn conventions of the art in which it operates,
that tears away the tinsel trappings and bids art and beauty spring forth
clean and untrammeled, to forge for themselves new forms that shall be
fitting for the urge of today.
</p>

<p>
The name by which this force is known in every day parlance is Miss
Harriet Monroe, and its manifestations are twofold—as poet and as editor.
<a id="page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>
As editor she has created and kept alive the courageous little magazine
<em>Poetry: A Magazine of Verse</em>, which might almost, so far as Chicago is
concerned, be called the spiritual older sister of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>. It,
too, in its own field, stands for the revolt of today against the hide-bound
spirit of yesterday, and it, too, is a thorn in the side of the Philistines.
</p>

<p>
The most recent manifestation of Miss Monroe’s influence is, however,
in her character as poet. She has collected together a large number of
poems, most of which have already appeared in the leading magazines and
have been widely copied, and has brought them out under the title <em>You and I</em>.
Seeing them so collected, one is much better able to get a perspective on the
poems themselves, and on the very interesting personality behind them.
And they bulk large. Unquestionably this is one of the most important of
the recent books of poetry.
</p>

<p>
<em>You and I</em> is essentially modern in spirit and in treatment. Miss Monroe
has the power of looking with the eyes of the imagination at many of
our modern institutions. <em>The Hotel</em>, <em>The Turbine</em>, <em>The Panama Canal</em>, <em>The
Ocean Liner</em>—these are some of the subjects she treats with a real understanding
and a sweep of vision that quite transfigures these work-a-day
objects. And she is equally at home when writing of the great emotional
complexity of <em>State Street at Night</em> or the simpler but more profound
poignancy of the <em>Elegy for a Child</em>. Indeed, one of the noticeable things
about the book is the unusually large range of themes treated.
</p>

<p>
There is also in this book the primal, but unfortunately rare, gift of
wonder. This is one of the essential qualities of true poetry, and it furnishes
Miss Monroe with the key-note of the book, an open-eyed, courageous facing
of fate, and an unshakable belief in the redeeming power of beauty.
</p>

<p>
This little lyric may serve as an introduction to the spirit of the book:

Scharmel Iris: Italian Poet
</h3>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Milo Winter</span>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Scharmel Iris, the first of the Italians in America to write poetry
in English is a Florentine who was brought to Chicago when but an
infant. Before his tenth year his poems attracted attention and were warmly
praised by such men as Ruskin, Swinburne and Gosse. Later Francis Thompson
and Richard Le Gallienne expressed appreciation. These poems which
originally appeared in leading publications of England and America are
gathered together for the first time and printed by the Ralph Fletcher Seymour
Company (Fine Arts Building, Chicago; $1.00 net). The volume, entitled
<em>Lyrics of a Lad</em>, contains his most desirable and characteristic lyrics and
is a serious contribution to our poetic literature. These poems came to be
respected as art through their freshness and originality—there are no trite,
worn-out, meaningless phrases, or words of an abstract, generalized significance.
Immortal beauty is a vision in his eyes and a passion in his heart,
and he has labored to reveal it to the world. Art is a creation of men’s
minds, and because Mr. Iris’s creation is direct and spontaneous it becomes
greater art. This volume is not post-Miltonic or post-Swinburnian or post-Kiplonian.
This young poet has the good sense to speak naturally and to
paint things as he sees them. Because this book is Scharmel Iris it is distinctive.
It is without sham and without affectation. The announcement of its
publication and his poems in <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> brought the publisher
three-hundred orders. The book, slender and well-printed, has more real
poetry than any volume of modern verse it has been our good fortune to read.

a miscellaneous quotation of lines will help:

<p class="noindent">
and there are many other striking lines. In <em>The Visionary</em> a poet steals the
pennies on a dead man’s eyes to buy himself bread, and, after his death, the
money denied him in life is in turn placed on his sightless eyes. It is irony
of the bitterest sort. <em>Late January</em> is an excellent landscape—interpretive
rather than descriptive. <em>Scarlet—White</em> is struck at the double standard, and
is a strong and powerful utterance. <em>April</em>, <em>Canzonette</em>, <em>Lady of the Titian
Hair</em> are exquisite and charming lyrics. Three graceful compositions are
<em>The Heart-Cry of the Celtic Maid</em>, <em>Tarantella</em> and <em>Song for a Rose</em>. <em>The
Ugly Woman</em> will cause discussion, but it is good art. The trio of <em>Spring
Songs</em> and <em>Her Room</em> are well nigh perfect. <em>Mary’s Quest</em> is very tender, as
is also the <em>Twilight Lullaby</em>. <em>The Leopard</em>, <em>Fantasy of Dusk and Dawn</em>, <em>The
Forest of the Sky</em> are wonderfully imaginative, and were written in Chicago,—in
the grime and barrenness of Halsted Street. There is a poignant thing of
five lines, a mother who is going blind over the death of a son. Her despair
is hopeless and tragic—she makes a true and awful picture of realism in her
grief. <em>Heroes</em> treats of the nameless heroes, daily met and overlooked. The
love poems are sincere as all love poems must be. In <em>Foreboding</em> the note of
sadness is emphatic—almost dominant; but there is more than mere sadness
in it; it is not a minor note. It is tragedy, really, that speaks in such poetry:

<em>The Mad Woman</em> (printed in <em>Poetry</em>) is as excellent as it is unusual, and
few finer things have been done in any literature.

<p>
There is a fine flowing harmony about the poetry of Scharmel Iris that
denotes a power far beyond that revealed by many of today’s singers. The
poems are colorful and certainly musical and they display an adequate technique.
Such a gift as his, revealed in a number of very fine achievements,
gives promise of genuine greatness. After many years of discouragement
and the hardest work, he has at last found a publisher who bears the cost of
the edition, purely on the merit of the work. It contains a preface by Dr.
Egan, American minister in Copenhagen, an attractive title-page decoration
by Michele Greco, and a photogravure portrait of the author. By advancing
the work of living poets like Mr. Iris one can repay the debt he owes to the
old poets. This poetry (as <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> remarked) is not merely
the sort which interests or attracts; it remains in your mind as part of that
art treasure-house which is your religion and your life.

The Poetry of T. Sturge Moore
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
In an early number of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> a correspondent remarked that
an article I had the honor of contributing sounded a rather curious note
inasmuch as it was a piece of pure criticism in a magazine deliberately given
over to exuberance.
</p>

<p>
Well, it is now my turn to stand up for exuberance as against a contributor,
A. M., who gives the poetry of T. Sturge Moore criticism only, and, in
my humble opinion, criticism as unfair as would be a description of Notre
Dame rendered altogether in terms of gargoyles and their relative positions.
</p>

<p>
Would it not be more in the spirit of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> to point out
in the title poem of Mr. Moore’s book, <em>The Sea is Kind</em>, such passages as the
two following:

Amy Lowell’s Contribution
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Sword Blades and Poppy Seed</em>, by Amy Lowell. [The Macmillan
Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
... And Amy Lowell’s new volume of verse refutes all the critical
disparagement of <em>vers libre</em>, imagism, or “unrhymed cadence,” as Miss
Lowell herself chooses to call her work. For she demonstrates that it is
something new—that it is a clear-eyed workmanship which belongs distinctly
to this keener age of ours. Miss Lowell’s technical debt to the French—to
the so-called Parnassian school—has been paid in a poetical production
that will put to shame our hackneyed and slovenly “accepted” poets. Most
of the poems in her book are written in <em>vers libre</em>, and this is the way Miss
Lowell analyzes them: “They are built upon ‘organic rhythm,’ or the rhythm
of the speaking voice with its necessity for breathing, rather than upon a
strict metrical system. They differ from ordinary prose rhythms by being
more curved and containing more stress. The stress, and exceedingly
marked curve, of any regular metre is easily perceived. These poems, built
upon cadence, are more subtle, but the laws they follow are not less fixed.
Merely chopping prose lines into lengths does not produce cadence; it is
constructed upon mathematical and absolute laws of balance and time. In
the preface to his Poems, Henley speaks of ‘those unrhyming rythms in
which I had tried to quintessentialize, as (I believe) one scarce can do in
rhyme.’ The desire to ‘quintessentialize,’ to head-up an emotion until it burns
white-hot, seems to be an integral part of the modern temper, and certainly
‘unrhymed cadence’ is unique in its power of expressing this.”

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span> powerful appeal to peoples, especially to the German peoples, it
was with this that the nineteenth century began. Still in the eighteenth
century there were no peoples, only dynasties, courts. All life revolved
around these courts. On the crumbs that fell from royal tables, peoples
lived. For the sake of these crumbs, peoples crawled and crouched and
cringed. Then came the Corsican! He trod under foot all these gracious
sovereigns. The greater selfishness of the giant swallowed up the selfishness
of the pygmies. Germany was still but an historical memory. Europe
seemed to have but one will: the will of Napoleon. In the collapse of
dynasties, peoples began to consider themselves. Preachers of repentance
arose who interpreted the sufferings of the people in a way that could be
understood. The Napoleonic thunder awoke them from the sleep of centuries.
There came the prophet Fichte with his ever-memorable <em>Reden an
die deutsche Nation</em>. A living divine breath blew over the dead bones of
the Fatherland until they became alive again. And as the people considered
and reflected upon themselves, and showed the astonished world that
they were still there, the judgment that was executed against the royal
courts was turned against their executor. The German phoenix arose from
its ashes, the people revealed their unwithering power, their eternal life. A
rebirth of the people’s life, this was the program of the major prophet
Fichte. Folk culture, folk education, this was to create a new self within
the folk, a free self, dependent upon a life of its own, instead of a self
that was unfree, dismembered, unsettled. And all the best, freest, noblest
spirits went about the work with a will to renew the folk life in head and
heart and hand.
</p>

<p>
Did this work succeed? Was even an auspicious beginning made?
Or, was a false path taken from the very start? Confessedly opinions
deviate most widely as to all this. But among those who consider this
work as abortive and bungling, no one has aired his displeasure—if not,
indeed, his disgust and distemper—so energetically as <em>Friedrich Nietzsche</em>.
The Germans grew proud of their folk schools, where every one could learn
to read and write, if nothing more. But Nietzsche raged: “Everybody can
learn to read and write today, which in the long run ruins not only the
writing, but the thinking as well!” The Germans founded libraries, built
reading halls, and art institutes, that the spiritual treasures of humanity
might be as widely available as possible. But Nietzsche scoffed: “Once
there was the Spirit of God, now—through its introduction into the masses
it has become <em>Pöbel</em>, the vulgar plebeian mob!” He even called the whole
German culture <em>pöbelhaft</em>, vulgar, coarse, plebeian; German manners, unlike
<a id="page-41" class="pagenum" title="41"></a>
French, inelegant and unrefined; ochlocracy or mobocracy, the democratic
instinct of modern civilization—to Nietzsche, the grave of all genuine
human life.
</p>

<p>
In the tendency of the times there is undoubtedly the danger of leveling
men, of uniformizing their culture, consequently of externalizing their culture.
Nietzsche’s aversion to this tendency is understandable, and is well
worth laying to heart. For example, religion ecclesiasticized is <a id="corr-15"></a>disspiritualized;
morals conventionalized are degraded; so is art; so is even science, as
is seen in the “science made easy” cults and courses. Nietzsche made it
the special business of his life to dam back this current in the affairs of
our modern world. To him, the preaching of the equality of all men was
the most dangerous lie of the last century. Therefore, he preached the
inequality of all men; required of men that they should not be ironed out
to the same smoothness, that they should not all be hand and glove with
each other, but on the contrary, that they should be aware of their manifold
inequalities, keep their distances, and that thus great and small might be
clear as to their real differences. <em>Not</em> liberty, equality, fraternity, but the
<em>Eigenheit</em>, the peculiarity, the uniqueness, the <em>own-ness</em> of the human personality,
the right of man to his <em>Eigenheit</em>, the pleasure in its unfolding
and formation—this was to be the watchword of the new culture.
</p>

<p>
This was what Nietzsche required. He based his requirement upon
the fact that every man is an unrepeatable miracle. He never was before,
he never will be again, except in his own self. This fact is almost self-evident.
It must be kept in mind especially when we place a man into
relation with his surroundings. A man cannot possibly be explained merely
as a result of his environment. No man can be so explained, least of all
a superior individual who has awakened to a self-conscious life, of distinctive
personality, and who is inwardly aware of the mystery of his own
person. Here scientific inquiry, with its descriptions and explanations,
halts. At this point science ceases and we must resort to intuition and
interpretation of life’s deepest mysteries.
</p>

<p>
Nietzsche was right in his requirement. Man is an unrepeatable
miracle. But may we not go even further than Nietzsche did? All life is
peculiar and singular and unique. Behold the billowy field of grain!
Countless stalks bend to the breeze. The whole seems to be but a great
homogeneous mass. But take any two of these stalks and consider them
more minutely, compare them with each other. Each is something special,
something with an individual life of its own. Pluck an ear from the stalk.
One grain is side by side with another, one looks for all the world just like
another. But, in fact, no one is just like another. And from each grain
a special stalk grows, so special that the like of it was never in the world
before. Or, you wander along the beach. Innumerable are the grains of
sand on the shore of the sea. The multitude of grains form indeed a uniform
mass, so uniform that its very uniformity wearies and pains the eye,
<a id="page-42" class="pagenum" title="42"></a>
if it is looked at for long. But look sharply, consider any two of these
grains of sand. Each is something for itself. In the whole illimitable mass,
you find no second grain just like the first. What is true of the little grains
of sand is true of every drop in the wide and deep sea; true of every mote in
the air, of every least particle in vast shoreless cosmic spaces. Then, too,
there are the stars—one star differs from another star in glory, as Paul saw
and said long ago.
</p>

<p>
All this I call the wealth of nature, the wealth, if you will, of God.
In this eternal life, nothing is ever repeated or duplicated. This I call
infinite creative power. Never and nowhere does the weaving and waxing
world deal with copies. Everywhere and everywhen the world creates
an original fontal life of its very own.
</p>

<p>
Then should not man be awakened to such a life—man in whose eyes
and soul all this singular and peculiar life is mirrored? Should it be man’s
lot alone to be excluded from all this superabounding fulness of original
life? Should he be offended at what is a blessing to all other creatures,
fear their fulness, find the true task of his life in the renunciation of this
fulness? To be sure, the centripetal, solidaric forces of life do indeed
awaken in man. With the breadth of his spirit man spans the greatest and
the least, compares the likest and the unlikest, combines the nearest and the
farthest. But, for all that, he would sin against life, he would commit
spiritual suicide, were he to use this systematic power of thought to overpaint
gray in gray the variegated world with its colorful magnificence, to
make everything in his own world so similar, so uniform and so unicolored,
everything that was divinely destined and created for an existence of its
own. From everything that was repeated or duplicated in the world would
ascend an accusation to God in whose life all human life was rooted. We
who would thus be only a repetition of another would have the feeling
that we were so much too much, that we were superfluous in the world!
For the proof that we are not superfluous in life is to be found in the fact
that no one else can be put into our place, can be confounded with us, that
there is a gap in life, in the heart, into which no one else can fit, and
that if ever another does occupy our place in life, the gap abides, surviving
as the only trace of our existence in the human heart, corresponding to
our image and our nature. To be superfluous in the world, to fill therein no
place of one’s own, to drift and drag about with this feeling—the feeling
of all this is alone the real damnation of life, the worst hell that there is
in this or in any other world. But the feeling, even with the minimum
capital of life, which yet we may call our own—the feeling that one makes
a necessary, organic, irreplaceable contribution to the possessions of humanity,
this is life indeed; who has this life, and keeps it alive, knows
more joy and bliss than any other heaven can guarantee.
</p>

<p>
A life of one’s own that shall yet serve the life of all—there is the
consummation devoutly to be wished! In these days we hear much about
<a id="page-43" class="pagenum" title="43"></a>
decadence and the decadent. What does that mean? At bottom, the
decadent seeks to escape the diremption of the modern man between the
individual and the social, by affirming the former and negating the latter.
The individual, the social cell, detaches itself from the whole organization,
from the social body, without considering that he thereby dooms himself to
death. The cell can just as little exist without the organism, as the organism
without the cell. Decadence is the last word which anti-social individualism
has to say to our time. The history of this individualism is the
judgment of this individualism. The man who fundamentally detaches
himself from society cuts the arteries of life. Still the man must be his
own man, and not another, even that he may give a service of his own to
society, as a cell must be its own cell and not another if it is to construct
and constitute the organism of which it is so small a part. Besides, man
is not entirely like a cell. He is in an important sense a supersocial being,
as the cell is not super-organic. So we may as well go on with our discussion
of the Nietzschean uniqueness and <em>own-ness</em> of personality. Personality
is both super-individual and supersocial. We have its truth in value-judgment
and not simply in existence-judgment.
</p>

<p>
Somewhere in the old forgotten gospels there is a grim stirring word:
Enter by the narrow gate, for the gate is broad and the road is wide that
leads to destruction, and many enter that way. But the road that leads
to life is both narrow and close, and there are few who find it.
</p>

<p>
Yes, indeed! It is a narrow, a very narrow gate through which men
enter into life; a small, a very small path that leads to this narrow gate.
There is room for only one man at a time—only one! There is one precaution
with which man must sharpen all his wits, if he is to have regard
for the way, so that he may at no moment lose sight of the way; or if his
feet are not to lose their hold and slip, if he is not to grow dizzy and
plunge into the abyss. This is not every man’s thing; it costs stress and
strain and tension; it needs sharp eyes, cool head, firm and brave heart.
It is much easier to stroll along the broad way, where one keeps step with
another, where many wander along together; and if there but be one that
is the guide of all, then of course all follow that one step by step. On
this broad way no one need take upon himself any responsibility for the
right way. Should the leader mislead his blind followers, the latter would
disbelieve their own eyes rather than their leader, would “confess” that the
false broad way was nevertheless the right way, rather than condemn their
own blindness and indolence. These are the <em>Herdenmenschen</em>, the herd men
who cannot understand that there is a strength which only the man feels
who stands alone. These are the men who have no stay in themselves and
seek their stay, therefore, in dependence upon others; possess no supplies
of their own, and ever therefore only consume the capital which others
amass.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-44" class="pagenum" title="44"></a>
Friedrich Nietzsche summoned men out and away from this herd.
Friedrich Nietzsche warned men of the broad way and guided their minds
to the solitary paths which are difficult and perilous indeed, but along which
the true life is to be lived. These small paths, these are the paths of the
creative: “Where man becomes a new force, and a new law, a wheel rolling
of itself, and a first mover!” There every force of his being becomes a
living creative force. No thought is repeated, no feeling, no decision, is
a copy of something which was before. This is a new faith in man. He
does not need to live by borrowing. There is a stratum in his own soul, in
whose hidden depths veins of gold are concealed, gold that he needs but to
mine in order to have a worth of his own, a wealth of his own. This is a
new love to the man who conceals undreamt of riches underneath his poor
shell, divine living seedcorn preserved with germinating power underneath
all the burden of the dead that overlay him. Here Nietzsche, the godless
one, chimes with the godly Gallet who values the error which man of himself
finds more highly than the truth he learns by rote. To be sure, man possesses
this that is his very own, this power of the creator, in his soul, not
in his coat, not in his manners, not in life’s forms of social intercourse.
The man is still far from having everything his very own, if he be only
different from others, if he only says “no” to what others say “yes.” There
are people enough whom one might call reverse <em>Herdenmenschen</em>. They
esteem themselves original because they act, think, speak differently from
what they see everybody else doing, and yet they are only the counterpart
of others, they receive the impulse of their life, not from what is living in
their ownselves, but from opposition to what they themselves are not.
What they call beautiful is not beautiful to them because it grips their
souls, fills their hearts with the free joy of vision, but because others cannot
endure it, and call it ugly. The good for which they strive is not good
because they have themselves thereby become stronger, greater, better, and
will always become stronger, greater, better thereby, but a caprice which
they follow, making it a law to themselves, because others may not do so.
As if anyone could live on negation, or create by digging mole tracks in
the fields and meadows of men! Even the small path is path, and every
path has a goal, and the goal of every path is a “yes” and not a “no!” Therefore,
Friedrich Nietzsche, Contemner of <em>Pöbel</em>, of the plebeian mass, would
count all as <em>Pöbel</em> who held themselves aloof from the broad way purely because
they saw how many there were that trod it. He would also call the
most select and sought-after exclusivists <em>Herdenmenschen</em> were they to
derive the reason of their action and passion merely from the mania and
disease to be different from the herd.
</p>

<p>
Plain, indeed, then, is Nietzsche’s great requirement. Let every man
honor and safeguard his unrepeatable miracle, and be something on his
own account. This cultural requirement is supplementation and development
of the moral ideal of the great German prophet at the beginning of
<a id="page-45" class="pagenum" title="45"></a>
the nineteenth century, speaking as he did out of the blackest night of a
people’s life. Fichte, too, would create a folk, no <em>Pöbel</em>. To be folk, all
that is <em>Pöbel</em> must be overcome. <em>Pöbel</em>, that is all that lives herd-like,
and borrows the impulse of its action and passion from others, not from
itself; or, more accurately, <em>Pöbel</em>, to speak with Nietzsche, is wherever
man is not himself, but his neighbor! <em>Pöbel</em> signifies, therefore, not a
human class, not a social layer of the population, but a <em>disposition</em>. Everywhere
there are aristocratic <em>Pöbel</em>, wherever men pride themselves on
reciprocally surpassing each other in flunkey-like ways of thinking. There
is a political, a partisan <em>Pöbel</em> which counts it human duty to help increase
the great pride that runs after a leader on the broad way of the herd.
There are <em>Pöbel</em> in science and in art, wherever men do not dare to ally
themselves with a cause, a principle, a work, until some “authority” has
pronounced judgment in the matter. There are pious <em>Pöbel</em> who cock their
ears for what their neighbor believes, who, even in questions of conscience
and of heart, are impressed by large numbers and determined by vast herds.
<em>Pöbel</em> shouts its “hosanna” and its “Crucify him” without knowing what
it does, and blasphemes every body who does not shout with it. To what
shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplace,
who call to their playmates, “We piped to you and you would not
dance, we lamented and you would not beat your breasts.”
</p>

<p>
We are all influenced by what the medicinal psychologist is wont to
call “suggestion”—influenced, that is, by alien thoughts, alien expressions
of will. What we repeatedly hear comes to lose its strangeness; we come
to think that we have understood it and appropriated it. Our taste, our
moral judgment, our religious faith, these and such as these are probably
far more alien than domestic, far more the life of others than our own,—in
a word, suggestion. We have not tested the alien, elaborated it, made
it our own. We have let these uncritically empty themselves into the vessel
of our spirit where they coalesce, motley enough at times, with the
rest of the content. There is, therefore, something of <em>Pöbel</em> in all of us,
whether we control others or are controlled by others. To form out of
<em>Pöbel</em> strong and free personalities of our very own,—as a cell is formed
from the precellular stuff of life, as the flowers and fruit of a tree are
elaborated from the sap and substance at their disposal,—this is the first
and best service we can render society. To form out of <em>Pöbel</em> a folk,
not a distinctionless mass that wanders along the broad way to damnation,—a
community of men, where each walks the narrow path of life, no
herd in which the individual only has his number and answers when it
is called,—a body with many members, each member having its own life
and its own soul,—<em>also sprach Jesu-Fichte-Nietzsche</em>!

made a reference to Harold Munro’s Poetry Book Shop in London
which may have seemed a little unfair to people who know
the high aim of Mr. Munro in that undertaking of his. Miss
Lowell did not intend it to be so; in fact she plans for an early
number of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> an article which shall set forth
the interesting work that is being done there. In the meantime
we have been shown a letter from Robert Brooke, one of the
Poetry Book Shop group, which is certainly not open to the charge
of “preciousness”. Mr. Brooke is in the War; he is a Naval Sub-Lieutenant
for service on land, attached to the Second Naval Battalion
and was sent with the relief force to Antwerp “just too
late”. The letter reads: “There I saw a city bombarded and a
hundred thousand refugees, sat in the trenches, marched all night,
and did other typical and interesting things. Now we’re back for
more training. I will probably get out again by Christmas....
There’s nothing to say, except that the tragedy of Belgium is the
greatest and worst of any country for centuries. It’s ghastly for
anyone who liked Germany as well as I did.... I’m afraid
fifty years won’t give them the continuity and loveliness of life
back again! Most people are enlisting. —— and his brother
have gone into cavalry; I’m here: among my fellow officers being
Denis Brown, one of the best musicians in England; Kelly, the
pianist who won the Diamond Sculls; one of the Asquiths; a man
who has been mining in the Soudan; a New Zealander—an Olympic
swimmer; an infinitely pleasant American youth, called ——,
who was hurriedly naturalized “to fight for justice” ...
and a thousand more oddities. In the end, those of us who come
back will start writing great new plays.” Our London correspondent,
Mr. E. Buxton Shanks, sends a note with infinite pathos
in it. “I enclose a letter for December,” he writes. “Unfortunately
it may be my last. The greater part of my regiment went to
France last Monday and I expect to follow it before long, so that
this may be not only my last Letter to <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>, but
also my last piece of literature for ever and ever.”

<em>Russia in Storm</em>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">F</span><span class="postfirstchar">rom</span> Russian newspapers and private letters that have been
smuggled through into this country we learn about the great
resurrection that is taking place in the land of extremes. The war
has shaken the dormant giant, and life is pulsating with tremendous
vigor. The abolition of liquor-trade has had an unbelievable effect
on the population; the fact that this reform was promulgated by
the government which has thereby lost nearly a billion yearly revenue,
is of inestimable significance. The Czar and his counsellors
have finally awakened to recognize the impossibility of reigning
over a country without citizens, and liberal reforms on a wide
scope are being announced. Nationalities and parties are united
under a new slogan: “Down with Nationalism! Long live Patriotism!”
Even the reactionary organs have abandoned their
chauvinistic tone, and they preach equality and freedom and the
abolition of the bureaucratic régime which they ascribe to Germanistic
influences. The revolutionary parties, however, are not intoxicated
with the momentary upheaval; they have had too many bitter
experiences to be lulled by promises from the throne. Of all the
warring nations the Russian socialists were the only party to take
an openly antagonistic attitude towards their government. They
were demonstratively absent from the Douma when the war manifesto
was announced, and later they gave out a declaration in which
they expressed their condemnation of the government and its policy.
Recently an official communication stated a discovered conspiracy
among the radical members of the Douma. It is clear that the
revolutionists intend to forge the iron while it is hot; this time
affords them a rare opportunity for forcing the Autocrat to yield
to the demands of the people and in defiance of popular sentiments
and drummed up patriotism, the uncompromising fighters
brave their way forward to the ultimate goal. It is great life in
Russia!

<span class="firstchar">I</span> was going Home!
</p>

<p>
It was seven o’clock on a clear, cold, snowless night in December—the
ideal night for a journey. Behind me, Chicago:—noise, jangle, rush,
and dirt; great crowds of people; a hall room of agonizing ugliness, with
walks of a green tone that produces a sort of savage mental biliousness and
furniture of striped oak that makes you pray for destruction by fire; frayed
rugs the color of cold dishwater and painted woodwork that peels off like
a healing sore; smells of impromptu laundry work, and dust that sticks like
a hopeful creditor; an outlook of bare brick walls, and air through the
window that should have been put through a sieve before entering. All
these—and one thing more which makes them as nothing: the huge glory of
accomplishment.
</p>

<p>
Before me?... It was snowing hard as we steamed in. There
came a clanging of brakes, a cold blast of snowy air through the opened
doors, a rush of expectant people; and then, shining in the glow of a flickering
station light, one of the loveliest faces I’ve ever seen—my sister’s,—and
one of the noblest—my “Dad’s.” Then a whirring taxi, a luxurious adjustment
to comfort in its dark depths, a confusion of “So <em>glad</em> you’re here,”
and “Mother’s waiting at home”; a surging of all my appreciation at the
beauty of young Betty, with her rich furs and stunningly simple hat and
exquisitely untouched face; a long dash through familiar streets until we
reached the more open spaces—the Country Club district where there are
only a few homes and a great expanse of park and trees; and finally a
snorting and jerking as we drew up before a white house from which lights
were shining.
</p>

<p>
Now this little house is all white, with green shutters and shingles,
with a small formal entrance porch, like a Wallace Nutting print, in front,
and a large white-pillared, glass-enclosed living-porch on one side. A red
brick walk of the New England type leads up to it, and great trees stand like
sentinels at the back. On a winter night, when the red walk and the terrace
are covered with soft snow, when the little cedar trees massed around the
entrance sparkle with icy frost, when the warm light from the windows
touches the whiteness with an amethyst radiance—well, it’s the kind of
house that all good dreamers sometimes have the reward of dreaming about.
And when Mother opened the door, letting out another stream of light and
showing her there against the warm red background of the hall, I was convinced
that getting home was like being invited to paradise.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-52" class="pagenum" title="52"></a>
Of course we talked and laughed for an hour; and underneath it all
I was conscious, above everything, of the red and white room in which we
sat; of the roaring, singing fire; of the shadows it threw on the luxurious
rugs and old mahogany; of the book-lined walls; of the scattered magazines
on the long table; of the chiming grandfather’s clock; of the soft lights;
and—more than all—of the vase of white roses against the red wall.
</p>

<p>
“But you must hear the new Victrola records!” Mother cried. And so
I lay back in a deep chair with my face to the fire, and listened—listened
with my soul, I think, to some of the world’s great music: Sembrich and
Melba and Homer and Gluck; Paderewski and Pachmann, orchestras, operas,
and old, old songs; and finally my favorites—the violin ones. There was
Kreisler, with his perfect art, playing old Vienna waltzes, haunting Provence
folk songs, quaint seventeenth-century gavottes and dances; Maud
Powell putting new beauty into the Schubert <em>Ave Maria</em>, and that exquisite
tone-picture of Saint-Saëns called <em>The Swan</em>; and last of all Mischa Elman,
with his deep, passionate singing of Bach’s <em>Air for the G String</em> and
Tschaikovsky’s <em>Ye Who Have Yearned Alone</em>. There’s a beauty about
those last ones that is almost terrible, so close is it to the heart of human
sorrow.
</p>

<p>
“Well,” said Dad, a little later, “I don’t know about the rest of you,
but <em>I’m</em> going to bed. And first I mean to have some milk and a piece of
pumpkin pie. Does that attract a city girl?”
</p>

<p>
It did—to the extent of three glasses of milk, besides the pie. “You’ll
not sleep,” warned Mother; but I retorted that I didn’t care; I was too
happy to sleep, anyhow. And, besides, the kitchen, in its immaculate gray
and whiteness, was so refreshing that I wanted to stay there awhile. Large
baskets of grape fruits and oranges and red apples stood on the pantry
shelves; the stove was polished until it looked like a Sapolio advertisement;
and a clock, ticking loudly, gave the room that curious sense of loneliness
that a kitchen needs. I can conceive of a library without books, or a fireplace
without a fire, but never of a kitchen without a loud-ticking clock.
</p>

<p>
After <a id="corr-20"></a>a while we all trooped up to bed—up the white staircase with
the mahogany rail, and into fresh white bedrooms in such perfect harmony
with the snow outside.
</p>

<p>
“This house is positively sensuous!” I told Mother. “It’s an emotional
adventure just to come into it....”
</p>

<p>
I climbed into a big mahogany four-poster; but not to sleep—oh no!
I sat bolt upright with the silk comfortlet (oh luxury of luxuries!) around
my knees, and gazed out the windows: for from both of them I saw a fairyland.
It was all white—all except the amethyst shimmerings of boulevard
lights; and white flakes dropped one by one through the amethyst. Away
in the distance on both sides were faint outlines of woods—bare, brown
woods now covered warmly with snow. And over it all a complete and absolute
<a id="page-53" class="pagenum" title="53"></a>
stillness. Just as in spring I used to feel fairies leaping from every
separate violet and tulip and hyacinth for their twilight dance on the wet
grass, so now I felt a great company of snow fairies dancing in the faint
rays of amethyst that darted into the woods—dancing and singing and glittering
in their silver frostiness. And then a slow quiet wind would sound
far off in the branches of the oak trees; and gradually the fairy carnival
ceased and I went ecstatically to sleep.
</p>

<p>
The next morning, after breakfast in a dining-room of old blue and
white and mahogany, I stated my ideas of what one ought to do in such a
house. “I don’t want to go anyplace or see anyone or do anything. Don’t
plan luncheons or teas or other things. It will take a week to store up all
the impressions I want to. So please just let me stay here quietly and absorb
the atmosphere.”
</p>

<p>
And so my precious week began. In the mornings I’d put on boots—for
the snow was deep by this time—and take long tramps through the
woods. Then each afternoon had its distinct adventure: sometimes it would
be a mere wandering about from room to room standing before a specially-loved
picture or buried in a favorite old book. And what an enchanting
thing it is to read in such a setting: to look up from your book knowing that
wherever your eyes fall they will be rested; to feel your imagination sinking
into the soft depths of a reality that is almost dream stuff!
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the afternoon would have its hard-fought game of cards
between Dad and me—with the table drawn close to the fire, and Bertha
running in from the kitchen with a hearty offering of cider and hot doughnuts.
(Bertha always seemed to sense the exact moment when we declared,
with groans, that to wait another hour for dinner would be a physical impossibility.)
Sometimes at four o’clock I’d conceal myself in a mass of
cushions in the big swing on the porch, and wait for the darkness to come on,
loving every change of tone in the grayness until the boulevard lights blossomed
like flowers and made another fairyland. And always we’d have tea
by candle-light—on the porch in deep wicker chairs, or before the leaping
fire.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes after tea I’d take a two-mile tramp down town, stopping
at the post-office (because a post-office in a small town is a place worth seeing
at five o’clock in the evening) and trying deliberately to get cold and
tired before reaching home again, so that the warmth and comfort would
come as a fresh shock and joy. And then a quite wonderful thing would
happen: namely, the miracle of a superlatively good dinner. I shall never
forget those dinners! Not the mere physical pleasure of them, but their
setting: Mother feeling a little gossipy, and talking cozily of the day’s small
happenings; Dad in a mood of tolerant amusement at our chatter; and Betty,
usually in white, looking so adorable that even the roses on the table couldn’t
rival her.
</p>

<p>
But most perfect of all were the long evenings! First we’d read aloud
<a id="page-54" class="pagenum" title="54"></a>
a little Pater, just for the ravishing music of his language, and then Betty
would sing. I don’t know any lovelier singing than Betty’s; it’s so young
and fresh and wistful. And when she’d finish with the Brahms <em>Lullaby</em>
I could have cried with the beauty of it all. Later, when everyone had gone
to bed, I would creep downstairs again to lie by the fire and have the obliging
Mr. Mischa Elman play me another concert. <em>Ye Who Have Yearned
Alone</em> was the thing he’d play most often, for it has a surging sadness that
keeps one humble in the midst of happiness. Everything of yearning is in
it: the agonies of countless tragic loves; the sad, sad strivings for joy
and comprehension; the world-old miseries of “buried lives”; hopes and
fears and faiths—and crucifixions; ecstacies dying out like flames; utter
weariness of living—and utter striving to live.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
Oh, you people who have homes! Why <em>don’t</em> you realize what they
might yield you! When you find yourself uneager, stupefied with contentment,
ashamed of your vicious comfort—why not share your homes?...
Back in Chicago, I have a vision strong and soothing, like a poppy seed
that brings sleep. I close my eyes at night; and suddenly my bare walls are
lined with books; soft lights are lighted; in a great fireplace burns a crackling
fire that has in it sometimes soft sounds like bird-singing; and out of
the rumble of elevated trains, drowning the roar of traffic and bringing a
deep stillness, come the singing tones of a violin, rising and falling over an
immortal melody—<em>Ye Who Have Yearned Alone</em>.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">E</span><span class="postfirstchar">nough</span> of war poetry. An industrious statistician has calculated that
three thousand pieces have been printed since the beginning of August.
When our poets are unanimous in the choice of a subject, their unanimity is
horrible. We have had lyrical outrages from railway porters, dairymen,
postmen, road scavengers, and what not, with their names and professions
duly appended, in the delectable fashion set some time ago by <em>The English
Review</em>. Meanwhile, in France, young poets are killing one another. We
must arrange a balance-sheet of gains and losses when the war is done. M.
Charles Péguy is gone already; that is a loss which makes one fear for
Jules Romains and the rest who must be at the front in one army or the
other. The French and German casualty lists are not published in the English
papers: when the smoke clears off again the arts of the continent will
show a different complexion.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile we are beginning to ask, prematurely of course, what effect
the war will have indirectly on our own arts. The war of ’70 caused an
epoch of literary ferment in Germany and was at the back of much good
poetry. To that war we owe Detter von Liliencron, Richard Dehmel, and
Gerhart Hauptmann, who is, I freely admit, a great dramatist, though I
cannot abide him. In France it produced the tired subtleties of Kahn,
Régnier, and the other Symbolists. In Austria, a century of humiliation,
which has become almost a national habit, has evolved the tired elegance of
Hofmannsthal and the weary tenderness of Schnitzler who is so obviously so
sorry for all his characters as almost to make the reader weep with him.
If we win this war, what may we expect? We can be certain that the
English arts will react to the strain: the reaction will not necessarily be a
good one, unless the efforts of those who sit about at home and vulgarize
war are neutralized or ignored. The tone of our newspapers—and these
mould our minds, whether we like it or not—is now most insufferably ugly.
And as a result of victory, I fear a blatant hollow tone of exultation in our
poetry that—from a literary and social standpoint—is almost worse than
the languors of defeat. It will be well if we achieve victory when every
person in the country has been made to feel the cost of it. Three days knee-deep
in flooded trenches—our arts must draw strength from that dreadful
experience.
</p>

<p>
It is true perhaps that we do wish to feel the cost. We are supposed
to live in fear of a Zeppelin raid. In my opinion, half the inhabitants of
London constantly though secretly hope it. We feel that with a bomb or two
tumbling about our heads we shall be “in it.” To read the newspapers is
<a id="page-56" class="pagenum" title="56"></a>
like having a surfeit of the kind of book which is called “The Great War
of 19—.” I have read dozens of them and they move my imagination almost
as much as the reports—some of them, such as are well-written, like Mr.
Wells’s <em>War in the Air</em>, even more.
</p>

<p>
The result that we must pray for is a greater concreteness and reality
in our writing. We have developed an inhuman literary point of view which
is fundamentally insincere and which is never more ugly or less convincing
than when our poets try to be “modern.” Such poets as Emile Verhaeren—now
a refugee in London—treat factories and so forth, the typical products,
they think, of modern life, purely as romantic apparitions, much as the
romantic writers treated mountains and deserts, excuses for rhetoric and
flamboyant description. They have never felt the reality of them, because
modern life in its rapidity has outdistanced the poet’s mind in his attempt
to conceive it.
</p>

<p>
I hold no brief for “modern poetry” in that sort of sense: I do not
hold it necessary to write about these things. But if you will compose upon
a factory or a railway-station, you must feel what factories and railway-stations
really are; you must not take refuge in a romantic description of
lights and roaring machinery. The perpetually breaking high note of the
Futurists is merely a rather useless attempt to deal with a difficulty that we
all know. Perhaps the war will bring us rather suddenly and jarringly in
touch with reality. It is certain that the young men of the class from which
literature chiefly comes, have now in their minds a fixed and permanent
thought which from time to time comes up onto the surface of consciousness.
This thought is the thought of violent death. We have grown physically
and morally soft in security; but, as I write, affairs are reaching a
crisis in France, fresh regiments are being sent abroad. We each of us
wonder which may be the next to go.
</p>

<p>
This honest and undisguised fear—a man is wonderfully insensitive if
he does not feel it and a braggart if he will not admit it—has a powerful
and purifying effect on the spirit. Its spiritual action is comparable to that
of violent and maintained physical exercise. The flabby weight of our emotions
is being reduced and hardened: we have sweated away a great many
sick fancies and superfluous notions. The severe pressure of training for
war induces in us a love of reason, a taste for hard thinking and exactitude
and a capacity for discipline.
</p>

<p>
The art of war is fortunately an art that allows itself to be definitely
judged. Either you win your battles or you lose them. It is of no use to say
that Warmser was a great general whose subtle and esoteric methods of
making war have never been appreciated by a numskulled public. Napoleon
thrashed him and there is an end of argument. A soldier cannot resignedly
appeal from the fortunes of the field to the arbitrament of the future.
</p>

<p>
The consideration of these facts leads us to wish that poetry were in the
<a id="page-57" class="pagenum" title="57"></a>
same case; and we are beginning to feel both that poetry may become a more
active factor in normal life than hitherto and that a careful criticism may
remove it from the desert space of assertion and undefended preference
which it now inhabits. Possibly the war may help to cure us of our ancient
English muddle-headedness. We have awakened with surprise to find our
army an admirable and workmanlike machine. The South African war rid
us, in military affairs, of the incompetent amateur and the obstructive official.
Vague rumors of what the army had learnt there even reached other
departments of activity: possibly this war will infect us all with a new energy
and a new sense of reality. We may learn how to reach our ends by
taking thought and by cherishing ideas instead of plunging on in a sublimely
obstinate and indisciplined muddle. As for our war-poetry—I must
end where I began—it is merely a sloughing of the old skin, a last discharge
of the old disease.

November comes a bewilderment of elections, concerts, books, plays,
new magazines, bombs, exhibitions, and all the other things that seem to
have blossomed so futilely year after year. To set about the task of discovering
the significant in it all is more confusing than to attempt to trace
the origin of new species in a single May countryside.
</p>

<p>
Take the theatres, for instance. There is the usual increase in plays
which are so bad that even visiting travelling salesmen begin to suspect
their artistic integrity. There is Shaw’s <em>Pygmalion</em>, which some think is
second-rate Shavism well acted by Mrs. Campbell, and others believe is a
good play badly acted. There is Molnar’s <em>The Phantom Rival</em>, an amusing
and slender satire which is understood by one-quarter of the audience, and
applauded for its faults by the other three-quarters. MacDonald Hastings,
who aroused hopes with <em>The New Sin</em>, has descended to a very bad second-rate
in a vehicle for Nazimova called <em>That Sort</em>. Elsie Ferguson has
made a hit in <em>Outcasts</em>, written by Hubert Henry Davies,—the author of
the fascinating <em>Cousin Kate</em>,—as a vehicle for Ethel Levey, the former star
of unspeakable musical comedy in America who has become a great actress
in London. It is a play of sordid “realism,” whose <a id="corr-24"></a>principal function seems
to be to raise an almost academic question of morals and then disclaim
any moral intent by a solution which in the opinion of most of the audience
is either grossly immoral or disgustingly moral. Everything is topsy-turvy.
</p>

<p>
Early in the season the Schubert organ created some amusement by
<a id="page-58" class="pagenum" title="58"></a>
demanding the abolition of dramatic critics. Here are the managers, ran
the argument, responsible business men who put large sums of money
into new productions. Along comes your newspaper critic to the first night,
with a somewhat exalted standard of taste, a jaded appetite, and a reputation
for wit. Before the play is over he leaves, hastily writes a column
in which he exploits his own cleverness at the expense of the play, and
turns away many possible customers. This is not good business ethics.
If the play really is bad, let the public find it out gradually. They may
never find it out at all. If it is good, we really don’t need the critics for
publicity. The article was ingenuous and engaging. Most of our critics
are so undiscerning that we were glad to see them baited. Perhaps as a
result of this, Alan Dale and Acton Davies both left their respective papers.
But as if to heap coals of fire, the critics united in a roar of praise
for <em>The Beautiful Adventure</em>, a play so truly awful that the most ingenious
and expensive pushing could not even bluff the public into liking it. It
failed after a few precarious weeks.
</p>

<p>
Just now The Catholic Theatre Movement has created a diversion by
issuing their “White List” of plays and threatening to prosecute by law
the producers of “unclean” drama. They take occasion to compliment the
newspaper critics for abandoning to some extent artistic standards of criticism
and substituting moral standards. The movement will undoubtedly
tell against much undesirable filth, but it is needless to say that it would
be used with equal effectiveness against most works of genius which might
by some strange chance be produced.
</p>

<p>
Little Theatres are sprouting up by the handful. The Punch and
Judy Theatre is a clever imitation of the theatrical prototype, with benches
for seats, wall boxes for two only, and boy ushers. It is the personal
enterprize of Charles Hopkins, a Yale graduate who shows his enthusiasm
by combining not only the rôles of actor, manager, and producer, but
owner and playwright as well. He has not yet, however, put on any of
his own plays. Mrs. Hopkins, a really talented graduate of Ben Greet’s
company, plays the feminine leads. The Neighborhood Theatre is a quasi-philanthropic
undertaking with enough money behind it to aspire to the
new stage art in all its magnificence of the concrete dome and more expensive
settings. Perhaps the most interesting of all will be a new theatre
planned by the Washington Square villagers under the leadership of a
committee among whose members are Mr. and Mrs. Max Eastman and
Charles and Albert Boni. It will be supported principally by its own subscribers
at a very moderate expense, and will be as far as possible from
a philanthropic attempt to “elevate the stage.” It is the result merely
of a belief that here is a group of people who want to see more intelligent
drama than is ordinarily supplied, and that the dramatic material and acting
and producing ability are available. Plays by American authors will be
<a id="page-59" class="pagenum" title="59"></a>
used as far as possible, but the standards will not be lowered for the sake
of encouraging either authors or propaganda. Such a thing cannot avoid
being at least a healthy experiment.

Pavlowa opened in the Metropolitan a week after Genée had given a
Red-Cross benefit in a vaudeville theatre. The conjunction was a striking
example of the marked inferiority of a romantic form to a classic unless
the romantic vehicle is done honestly and supremely well. Genée gave
in ten minutes more genuine æsthetic pleasure by her perfection of line
than Pavlowa in a whole evening of half-done work. Pavlowa has proved
often enough that she can be one of the goddesses of the dance. Last
year she had with her Cecceti, her ballet master, and practiced with him
constantly. Only by such external vigilance can perfection be maintained.
This year, presumably for reasons of economy, Cecceti is not present. The
company is much weakened by the absence of the principal character dancers.
The opening ballet was a second-rate concoction with almost no real
dancing in it. And to top off the insult, a third of the program was devoted
to ordinary ball-room dances, which any number of cabaret performers
in the United States can do better than trained ballet people. It
was the usual tragedy of the artist who tries to popularize his work. An
enthusiast sitting next me said: “We are now seeing the funeral of good
dancing in America. Those who want this sort of thing will go to the
restaurants. And the others will say, ‘If this is ballet, give me baseball.’”
But there is still hope. The original Diaghilew company which plays yearly
in London and Paris is coming next season. Then we shall see romantic
ballet at its highest.
</p>

<p>
Only one other event must be mentioned now. While various discontented
persons, perhaps anarchists, have been leaving bombs about public
buildings, the socialists have elected Meyer London to Congress. In itself
this is not of great significance. It is interesting to see, however, that
twelve thousand people went to the public reception to him in Madison
Square Garden. It is still more interesting to compare what was said there
with ordinary political buncombe. Mr. London began by calling President
Wilson one of the ablest men this country has produced. He went on to
say “The business of socialism is to give intelligence to discontent.... When
I take my seat in Congress I do not expect to accomplish wonders. What
I expect to do is to take to Washington the message of the people, to
give expression there to the philosophy of socialism. I want to show them
what the East side of New York is and what the East side Jew is. I am
confident that I will get fair play. I will be given my opportunity, and I <a id="corr-26"></a>do
not intend to abuse it. Do not let yourselves be deceived by this victory.
You are good noise-makers, but you are poor organizers. Organize now
for the next campaign. Organize for victory, not by violence, but by the
greatest of all forces, the force of the human intellect. Give the people your
message clearly and make them think about it.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-60" class="pagenum" title="60"></a>
If the ballot fails because of lack of intelligence, is it reasonable to
suppose that violence will succeed with the same material? Or that any
arrangement under the sun for the welfare of human beings can take the
place of individual human quality? “My friends, mankind is something
to be surpassed!”

“The Philanderer”
</h3>

<p class="note">
(<em>Chicago Little Theater</em>)
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> most interesting thing about Shaw’s <em>Philanderer</em> as it was put on at
The Little Theater the latter part of November, was the new treatment
it received at the hands of the scenic artists of that precious institution. One
is tempted to use the trite but pretty figure and say that it was an instance of
an old gem in a new setting, only modifying it by the statement that <em>The
Philanderer</em> is merely a fake gem. The luster it may have had in the
eighteen-nineties is now almost entirely worn away. In short, its fun is
pointless. Ibsen, thanks largely to Mr. Shaw’s active propaganda, is a household
pet. Ibsen clubs are as obsolete as Browning clubs; while the “new”
woman as embodied in her present-day sister, the feminist, is too familiar and
too permanent a figure to be the subject of effective satire. That the play still
has appeal for a modern audience is due wholly to its characters, and yet these
stage people are not real. They are no more than caricatures, each effectively
distorted and exaggerated in the drawing, each effectively touched off
in monochrome. To use another overworked phrase, they are typically
Shavian in that they are not characters but traits of character. They are not
real people; they are perambulating states of mind, as are almost all of
Shaw’s creations, and the more emotional, rather than intellectual, the state
of mind, the wider its appeal.
</p>

<p>
But neither Shaw nor the play is the thing in this discussion. The
setting of the play, subordinate, no doubt, in intention, but predominating
because of its novelty, is what interested most the eyes of the layman
brought up for years on the familiar conventions of the ordinary-sized
theater. The action demands interior settings, but instead of the realistically-painted
canvas walls and wooden doors, The Little Theater gives
us tinted backgrounds with rectangular openings for entrances and exits.
The first act is done in gray, the second and third in blue, and the fourth
<a id="page-61" class="pagenum" title="61"></a>
in a soft green. The effect of people, particularly of women, moving against
such plain unrelieved tints is pictorial in the extreme. Each successive
movement, each new position is a new picture. The curtains parting on
the last act, showing the copper tint of a samovar, a vase of delicate pink
flowers, a white tablecloth, a handsome dark woman pouring tea, all against a
soft glowing green, gave one the feeling of seeing an artfully-composed,
skillfully-colored canvas at a picture gallery. And it suggested, more successfully
than any other setting I have ever seen, the home of a person of
refinement and restraint. Less successful was the setting for the second
and third acts. The use of indigo in representing an Ibsen club may be
satirical and it may be subtle, but its effect on the spectator after an hour
or so is depressing, and in the general atmospheric gloom that increases as
the act goes on the sparkle of some of the brightest dialogue is lost.
</p>

<p>
On the whole, the workings out of this new idea in scenery is suggestive
in its effect and lovely in its pictorial quality, but until the novelty wears off
it obtrudes itself upon the interest that belongs rightly to the play. Its cheapness
should ingratiate it to the professional producer. Naturally, the effect of
one unrelieved tint in the settings of a theater of ordinary size would be deadly
in its monotony, but the idea suggests of itself endless variation and improvements.
After leaving <em>The Philanderer</em>, with its obvious limitations,
with its uneven, at times amateurish acting, one cannot help wishing that our
every night plays had half the thought, half the taste, half the imagination
in their production that The Little Theater plays seem to have.

The Kneisel Quartet and Hofmannized Chopin
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
... And in the meantime war went on beyond the ocean. Strange, but
this absurd thought accompanied me as a shrill dissonance throughout the
concert. I could not help conjecturing what would be the result, if all the
warriors were brought together to listen to the Kneisel Quartet: Would
they not become ennobled, harmonized, pacified, humanized? Could they go
on with their dull work—for modern war gives no thrills for the individual
fighter—after Mozart’s Quartet in E Flat Major, which has the soothing
effect of a transparent vase? They might have found Brahms’s Quintet suffering
from this artist’s usual weakness—lack of sense of <em>measure</em>,—but the
Scherzo would certainly have elated the most avowed anti-German. The
four instruments performed their work so artistically that one forgot their
existence and heard “just music.” The only number that could have aroused
<a id="page-62" class="pagenum" title="62"></a>
international complications was the insincere grotesque of Zoltan Kodaly,
who succeeded in misusing an excellent source, Danuvian motives. “But
this is Modern”, I was shrapnelled. Well, call me a conservative, but if this
is modern music, then, in the name of Mozart and Beethoven, <em>Pereat!</em>
</p>

<p>
Still imagining a Marsian audience I was not dismayed even by the
appearance of the effeminate Chopin. For Josef Hofmann took the artistic
liberty of interpreting the gentle Pole in his own way, and the Scherzo in
B Flat Minor sounded as a virile volcanic charge. The pianist refuses to
take Chopin sentimentally, and he puts charming vigor even into the moon-beamed,
tear-strewn D Flat Nocturne, even into the frail ephemeral E Minor
Valse.

<h3 class="section" id="HOFMANSS_CONCERT">
Hofmann’s Concert
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
The spoiled child of the world’s pianism—Josef Hofmann—played Schumann’s
A Minor piano concerto with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at
two concerts during the first week in November. Both performances were
masterly and splendid in musical values.
</p>

<p>
Since he left his cradle, Hofmann has had the world sitting at his pianistic
feet and fingers so that he has come to take the most vigorous and sincere
homage as a matter of fact; and, perhaps for this reason, he occasionally
fails to merit it. He is insolent to his worshippers and furious with his critics.
Long and copious praise has gone to his head. His insolence is less poetic
and far less handsome than Paderewski’s, and Hofmann’s playing needs to
reach magnificent proportions before one is able to forget his bad-boyish
disposition.
</p>

<p>
But one does forget. For his musicianship and key-wizardry are things
of great beauty. Despite the fact that his scorn sometimes leads him to
abuse the piano, in the way of crude smashing blows, there is (in the
Schumann work, for instance, which displays him at his best) never a moment
in which he loses a rythmic grasp that is deeply satisfying. And when
he chooses, and doesn’t lose his temper, he can bring forth remarkable tonal
beauties from the box of wood and wire. There is an admirable drive in his
art. It is vital and powerful. One’s regrets are swallowed and quite forgotten
in listening to his artistic qualities of tone, rhythm, piano-color, and,
in fact, of genuine music.

<span class="firstchar">P</span><span class="postfirstchar">hysical</span> usefulness predominates in the make-up of every real piece
of craftsmanship. Its lines and the beauty of its decoration make up
its value.
</p>

<p>
Art does not rely on physical usefulness, form, or decoration. It is
its suggestiveness, its appeal to the imagination, its drawing out of sympathy
or hatred, its arousing of new and deep emotion—this is what gives the
fine arts their importance in life. Art should act as a screen for fine tragic
acts, for great emotions. Nature should be the pigment for the painter’s
brush, but not his aim. He should dilute it with his blood and marrow and
fling it on the canvas with determination.
</p>

<p>
Thus I pondered as I entered the twenty-seventh exhibition of American
Oil Paintings and Sculpture at the Chicago Art Institute. Wandering
from canvas to canvas, from one prize-winner to another, I felt all my hope
for a miracle vanish. They are so real, so true to life, so bereft of imagination,
that one wonders why anybody ever took the trouble to paint them.
</p>

<p>
Just look at these flowers, trees, cows, and nudes. I have seen them
many, many times exactly the same way and under the same circumstances
in life. They are “pretty” and will undoubtedly make a good decoration
in a middle-class home. This may be a worthy thing to do, but why should
it be called art? I think this is our punishment for great achievements
in the industrial field. No nation can go on building the fastest railroads,
the tallest skyscrapers, the largest factories, the fastest automobiles, without
paying for it by a loss of its finer æsthetic senses.
</p>

<p>
But I am getting away from the exhibition. It has become the fashion
to be disappointed with exhibitions both here and abroad—and with good
reason. As there are few good artists, the chances of getting them on a
jury is slight. The result is apparent: good pieces of craftsmanship are
hung along with fine pieces of art, and the prizes intended for fine art <a id="corr-29"></a>go
to good craftsmanship. In saying this I do not wish to join the popular
sport of hitting the jury and getting a round of applause. But how can
one escape these conclusions if he compares the prize-winner, <em>A Nude</em>, by
Richard E. Miller, with “<em>Under the Bough</em>,” by Arthur B. Davis, whose
rhythmically-moving figures and beautiful colors transport one to fairyland?
The figures remind me of Hodler, the foremost painter today in Switzerland,
who is sixty years old and younger than the youngest. Or compare the
prize with <em>Thomas and his Red Coat</em>, by Robert Henri. What simple forms
and colors—what a thorough understanding of a child and his world! Or
<em>The Widow</em>, by Charles W. Hawthorne. These are works of great simplicity,
<a id="page-64" class="pagenum" title="64"></a>
understanding, imagination, and individuality; they are monuments to
some fine feeling, dream, thought, or incident in the life of their creators.
</p>

<p>
As for the other prize winners—the disjointed color spots serving as
garden flowers and the chocolate box cover-design—I shall not discuss
them. The meaning of such stuff and the reason for awarding is too
obscure.
</p>

<p>
Outside the pictures mentioned above the following are worth seeing:
<em>The Venetian Blind</em>, by Frederic C. Frieseke; <em>Dance of the Hours</em>, by Louis
F. Berneker; <em>Winter Logging</em>, by George Elmer Brown; <em>Through the Trees</em>,
by Frank T. Hutchins; <em>The Harbor</em>, by Jonas Lie; <em>The Garden</em>, by Jerome
S. Blum; <em>Procession of the Redentore Venice</em>, by Grace Ravlin; <em>The Ox
Team</em>, by Chauncey F. Ryder; <em>Smeaton’s Quay, St. Ive’s</em>, by Hayley Lever;
<em>The Fledgling</em>, by Grace H. Turnbull. <em>A Hudson River Holiday</em>, by Gifford
Beal, looks much like a department store. In fact you may find everything
in this exhibition from a flag to a mountain—and all the popular
colors. The only thing that is missing is a “For Sale” sign, with a “marked-down”
price.
</p>

<p>
Seven pieces of sculpture by Stanislaw Szukalski, whose work the readers
of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> had a chance to see reproduced in the last number,
make up the most interesting part of the exhibition.

The original obscuring of the works of Grace Ravlin, Grace H. Turnbull,
Johansen, and Blum by the hanging committee deserves praise. But
I think if they really wanted to do something unusual they might have
thought of something better. For instance, hang all the rejected ones in
separate rooms, marked “rejected,” and let the visitors see and judge for
themselves. This would give the exhibition a bigger meaning. As it is,
it means confusion; and confusion asks persistently in this case: are the
fine arts anything in particular or just a mixture of craftsmanship, cleverness
(the usual companion of emptiness) and some undigested ideas?

<p class="book">
<em>The Enchantment of Art</em>, by Duncan Phillips. [John Lane Company, New
York.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">o</span> Mr. Phillips life is a <em>Fête Galante</em> in Watteau’s style. He sees
nothing but the elegant, the poetic, the joyous, the enchanting. I picture
him in a powdered wig, clad in a gorgeous costume of the Louis XV. period,
playfully lorgnetting life and art, and raving ecstatically over everybody and
everything. I confess, an all-loving person looks suspicious to me; but Mr.
Phillips’ book is so sincere, he adores things so pathetically, that I cannot
help enjoying him. He becomes irritating only at such moments when he
tries to be very much in earnest and breaks into absurd generalization. His
credo is Impressionism—in life and in art—but what an elastic term is Impressionism
to our dear enthusiast. Giotto, Titian, Da Vinci, Velasquez,
Corot, and Dégas were impressionists, and so were Shakespeare, and
Browning, and Keats, and Yeats, and Robert Bridges and who not!
He loves them all, loves beautifully, touchingly, but he fails pitifully to define
his beliefs. Why should he define? Why not be happy in enjoying good things
without giving reasons, without strained endeavors to form classifications
and definitions<a id="corr-32"></a>? Oh, those definitions! But we easily forgive the author his
absurd statements, we can even sympathize with the pain he gets when
contemplating the Futurists, whom he terms “lawless.” We forgive a
lover everything, for we feel grateful to him for the moments of bliss that
he generously shares with us. Truly, it is a book of religious joy.

<p class="book">
<em>The Age of Mother-Power</em>, by C. Gasquoine Hartley (Mrs. Walter M.
Gallichan). [Dodd, Mead and Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
One is compelled to take Mrs. Gallichan seriously in her visioning of
the future social status of men and of women in the world of sex; for the
results of close observation, research, and computation strengthen the most
reasonable prophecies. She is modest enough to state her big idea in simple
terms. She points out that, since society had in its primitive days a long
and up-tending period of mother-power, or female dominance; and, following
that, a protracted season of masculine rule, which is only now awakening
to feminine rebellion; it is clearly apparent that a new era is commencing,
in which all the old virtues of mother-right will be re-established in new
<a id="page-66" class="pagenum" title="66"></a>
forms, with the distinctly modern addition of that solitary virtue of male
despotism—father-protection. This is a theory—only a theory, if one
wishes to preen one’s own prejudice—which the writer approaches and
develops from various angles. She has fruitfully studied history, legend,
folk-lore, savages, and other departments of human life. Her deductions
are carefully and lucidly thought out, strongly original, and entirely worthy
of attention.

A Handbook of the War
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>The Great War</em>, by Frank H. Simonds. [Mitchell Kennerley, New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The European war threatens to become a prolonged phenomenon. To
the Trans-Atlantic public it is a keenly-felt tragedy; to us here it is an interesting
spectacle, the audience being requested to remain neutral, to refrain
from applause and disapproval. Even so, we are in need of a libretto.
Frank H. Simonds supplies us with a comprehensive account of the first act
of the drama. The lay reader is getting acquainted with the complexities of
the pre-war events and with the further developments of the conflict down
to the fall of Antwerp. The simple maps and the lucid comments make the
book not only instructive, but also readable. You must read the book if
you do not want to play the ignoramus in present-day floating, cinematographic
history.

The New Reporting
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Insurgent Mexico</em>, by John Reed. [D. Appleton and Company, New
York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
“Who is John Reed?”, asked the newspapers when, forgetting for the
moment their name-worshipping arrogance, they discovered that the best
reports from Mexico were coming, not from the veteran correspondents, but
from an unknown. The answer is that John Reed is the only “correspondent”
that the Mexican mix-up or the present European struggle has yet
brought to light, who has a really new and individual method of reporting.
These are not dogmatic, cock-sure, crisis-solving “articles” from the front,
but simple, vivid reporting of scenes and actions that have some reason for
being reported. And John Reed is about the only reporter who has shown
us that the Mexican people have visions of a future. The newspapers and
<a id="page-67" class="pagenum" title="67"></a>
those whose duty it seems <a id="corr-33"></a>to be to uphold the old idea are now crying that Reed’s
simple realism is too slight to be of value as history, and that he does not
“get beneath the surface”—but these people have still to see which kind of
reporting can endure as history.

Incorrect Values
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Life and Law</em>, by Maude Glasgow. [G. P. Putnam’s Sons, New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
A secondary title—“The Development of the Exercise of the Sex Function
Together with a Study of the Effect of Certain Natural and Human
Laws and a Consideration of the Hygiene of Sex”—is evidence <em>per se</em> that
the book is inadequate and superficial. In less than two hundred pages no
writer can more than hint at all these topics, and in trying to cover so much
ground the author really covers nothing. She tells over old facts and frequently
gives them what are now accepted as incorrect values. Her statements
are as sweeping as the scare heads of the old quack medicine almanacs.
She describes men as ignorant, intolerable, immoral monsters; and
women as being universally down-trodden and the sexual victims of man’s
unbridled appetite. The book is as full of “musts” and “shoulds” as the
rules of an old-fashioned school master. The author tells nothing new;
veers from science to sentimentality in a most disconcerting way; and adds
nothing to the constantly-increasing library of valuable sex books.

<p class="noindent">
<em>Abroad at Home</em>, by Julian Street. [The Century Company, New
York.] So far as what he will write is concerned we don’t give a rap whether
Shaw visits America or not. Yes, we don’t believe even <em>he</em> could lay out
the statisticians as Street does when he advises us on the purchase of pig iron;
or display such fiendish glee at the chance of hurting the feelings of a professional
Fair booster: or—well, every paragraph of every chapter is worth
reading.
</p>

<p>
<em>Reminiscences of Tolstoy</em>, by Count Ilya Tolstoy. [The Century Company,
New York.] The book is richly illustrated; this is its main value.
Nothing is added to what we have known about Tolstoy’s personality; we
have had numerous, perhaps too many, works on his intimate life; Sergeyenko
nearly exhausted the subject. True, we gain considerable information
about the great man’s son, Count Ilya, but, pray, who is interested in it?
</p>

<p>
<em>American Public Opinion</em>, by James Davenport Whelpley. [E. P. Dutton
and Company, New York.] The name is misleading: the book presents
a series of articles on American internal and foreign problems, written from
the point of view of a conservative. Why call Mr. Whelpley’s personal
opinion “American Public Opinion”? The articles on our foreign diplomacy
are valuable; they reveal our infancy in this peculiarly European art.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-68" class="pagenum" title="68"></a>
<em>Jael</em>, by Florence Kiper Frank. [Chicago Little Theater.] The production
of this play was treated subjectively in the last issue of this magazine.
In the reading of it the verse impresses one in much the same manner
as the viewing of the production. The two effects are so similar as to impress
one with the coherence and wonderful worth of the Chicago Little
Theatre in harmonizing the value of the play as literature with the importance
of the production.
</p>

<p>
<em>The House of Deceit.</em> Anonymous. [Henry Holt and Company, New
York.] Maurice Sangster had a “conviction in his heart that he was born
to make a conflagration of the Thames”. He came to London and proceeded
to attack the religious, political, and social institutions of the present day.
He serves merely as a blind for the author, who, attacking almost everything
under the sun, is not courageous enough to reveal his identity.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Mystery of the Oriental Rug</em>, by Dr. G. Griffin Lewis. [J. B. Lippincott
Company, Philadelphia.] To the lover of Persian and Caucasian
rugs the book will surely bring moments of exquisite joy. The author possesses
both knowledge and taste, and he tells us curious things about the
history of the oriental rug.

THE NEW MOVEMENT IN

By Sheldon Cheney
</p>

<p class="adp">
<em>8vo. Cloth, with sixteen plates and explanatory tissues. $2.00 net</em>
</p>

<p>
A most comprehensive book. There is not an aspect of the tremendously
interesting new movement in the theatre upon which Mr. Cheney does not touch.
And to every chapter he brings a wealth of knowledge gathered from a great variety
of sources—most of it at first hand. Furthermore, he writes with charm and
distinction: his book never fails, before all else, to interest. Gordon Craig, Max
Reinhardt, Bakst, and the Russian Ballet; Shaw, Galsworthy, the German, French
and American contemporary drama; David Belasco, the influence of the Greek
theatre, the newest mechanical and architectural developments in the theatre—all
these and others are in Mr. Cheney’s dozen brilliant chapters. Numerous
interesting illustrations add to the value of his book and make it one that no
lover of the theatre can afford to be without.

“Life at its beginning and its end
is bounded by a haunted wood.
When no one is watching, children
creep back to it to play with the
fairies and to listen to the angels’
footsteps. As the road of their
journey lengthens, they return more
rarely. Remembering less and less,
they build themselves cities of imperative
endeavor. But at night the
wood comes marching to their walls,
tall trees moving silently as clouds
and little trees treading softly. The
green host halts and calls—in the
voice of memory, poetry, religion,
legend, or, as the Greeks put it, in
the faint pipes and stampeding feet
of Pan.”

Here is Colonel Roosevelt’s own vivid narrative of his explorations in South America; his
adventures on the famous “River of Doubt,” his visits to remote tribes of naked and wholly
barbarous Indians, his 500-mile journey on mule-back across the height of the land between
the river systems of Paraguay and the Amazon, his observations on the most brilliant and
varied bird life of the South American tropics; hunting of the jaguar, the tapir, the peccary,
the giant ant-eater, and other unusual animals of the jungle; all of this varied panorama is
depicted in the author’s most graphic and picturesque style, full of the joy of new adventures.
The book is a permanent addition to the literature of exploration.

Balzac, Flaubert, and Thackeray,

The Man Behind the Bars
</p>

<p class="ada">
By <span class="smallcaps">Winifred Louise Taylor</span>
</p>

<p>
To gain the confidence of convicts, to know their
inner lives, and through this knowledge to attempt to
better prison conditions and methods of punishment
throughout the country is Miss Taylor’s life aim. In
this book, composed of a series of anecdotes, amusing,
pathetic, and all intensely interesting, she has embodied
the experience of many years of concentrated work
in this field. In its sympathy, an essentially human
quality, the book is thoroughly fascinating and gives
the point of view of a class too little known to most
of us.

After a number of years, the potency of the great Russian’s pen is again exercised.
This commanding volume of stories discloses varied aspects of the foremost
living writer among those who attracted universal attention to modern Russian literature.
The folk and psychology of Italy, to which country he retired in exile, supply the themes
of thirteen of the twenty-two tales, the others are of Russian life. Gorky’s admirers will
find in the collection a reaffirmation of the art which secured his high place among interpreters
of life through fiction.

<p>
The second group of Hauptmann’s Symbolic and Legendary Dramas gains unity by a
recognizable oneness of inspiration. The poet has become a seeker; he questions the
nature and quality of various ultimate values; he abandons the field of the personal and
individual life and “sends his soul into the infinite.” [A special circular, with contents
of the preceding volumes, will be mailed upon request to the publisher.]

SELF-CULTURE THROUGH
THE VOCATION
</p>

<p class="ada">
By EDWARD HOWARD GRIGGS
</p>

<p class="adp">
50 cents net; weight about 8 oz.
</p>

<p>
This new book in the Art of Life Series deals with work as a way to culture
and service. When the cry everywhere is vocational education, it is worth while to stop
and ask, What of the education that is possible through the vocation itself? This question
is studied in six chapters, with a lightness of touch that saves the teaching from
didacticism and gives it universal human appeal. The book is a companion study to the
author’s popular “The Use of the Margin.” Dr. Griggs is particularly satisfying in such
brief, trenchant studies of deep problems of life, and the new book should be of special
value to young people and to men and women longing to make each day yield its full
return in culture and wisdom.

THE DEATH OF A NOBODY
</p>

<p class="ada">
By JULES ROMAINS
</p>

<p class="adp">
$1.25 net; weight about 18 oz.
</p>

<p>
An amazingly perfect production of incomparable restraint and power; it reveals with
a quality enchaining the attention, the interwoven web of human revelations, romantic
from their very prosaicness. The life of one in other’s minds—the “social consciousness”
about which the sociologists have developed abstruse theories, is here portrayed explicitly,
with a fascination no theory can have. The uniqueness of the book is suggested by the
fact that the “Nobody” about whom the action revolves dies in the second chapter.
Though fiction, it will supply convincing arguments to believers in life after death. It is
not only a masterpiece of literary art, but might well be used as the concrete text of
the mind of the crowd. Translated from the French by Desmond MacCarthy and Sydney
Waterlow.

“First, last and all inclusive in Miss Amy Lowell’s poetic equipment is vitality
enough to float the work of half a score of minor poets.... Against the multitudinous
array of daily verse our times produce ... this volume utters itself
with a range and brilliancy wholly remarkable.... A wealth of subtleties and
sympathies, gorgeously wrought, full of macabre effects (as many of the poems
are) and brilliantly worked out ... personally I cannot see that Miss Lowell’s
use of unrhymed vers libre has been surpassed in English. This breadth and ardor
run through the whole fabric of the subject matter.... Here is the fairly
Dionysiac revelry of a tireless workman. With an honesty as whole as anything in
literature she hails any and all experience as stuff for poetry. The things of splendor
she has made she will hardly outdo in their kind.”

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
